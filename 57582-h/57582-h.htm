<h3 title="I. IN THE FARMHOUSE KITCHEN">CHAPTER I.<br />

<small>IN THE FARMHOUSE KITCHEN.</small></h3>

<p>It was a cold, dreary day and the country
was white with snow, causing the sparsely
settled village of Hickorytown to look even
more desolate than usual.</p>

<p>Old Deacon Joshua Marlowe and his wife
were seated in the dingy kitchen of the old
farmhouse, and it was plainly to be seen that
they were both worried and angry.</p>

<p>The farmer’s elbows were on his knees and
his head between his hands, and as he sat in
silent meditation he spitefully chewed a long
wisp of straw.</p>

<p>Martha Marlowe dried her eyes with her
apron now and then, and finally a decided
sniff evinced to her husband that she was
crying.</p>

<p>Instead of becoming more calm at this
sign of his wife’s grief, Deacon Marlowe
raised his head and scowled at her angrily.</p>

<p>“’Tain’t no use tew snivel about it, Marthy,”
he said, snappishly. “It’s got tew be
did, an’ thet’s all thar is about it! Sile’s got
the mor’gage on the farm, an’ he’s a-goin’ tew
foreclose, an’ all the cryin’ yew kin dew won’t
help matters any.”</p>

<p>“But where be we a-goin’?” asked his wife,
desperately. “I’ve asked Samanthy tew take
us, an’ she ’lows Tom won’t have us!”</p>

<p>“Tom’s a doggoned jackass!” was the
farmer’s answer. “Ef I’d a-knowed how tarnal
stingy he wuz, I’d never hev let Samanthy
marry him!”</p>

<p>“Waal, you wuz pretty sot on the matter,
Joshuy!” snapped his wife, with some spirit.
“The Lord knows, Samanthy didn’t want tew
marry him!”</p>

<p>There was no answer to this, so Mrs. Marlowe
grew bolder.</p>

<p>“Marion told yew how it would turn out
when yew done it, Joshuy, an’, in spite of that,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>yew done yewr best tew make Dollie marry
Sile Johnson! Not but that yew meant well
by the gal,” she added, a little more humbly,
“but it shows on the face of it that it ain’t
right fer a father tew interfere in sech matters.
Ef our children hadn’t been driv so by
their father, they might a-been here tew comfort
us this minute!”</p>

<p>She put her apron up to her face and burst
out crying now. Her mother heart had at
last conquered her fear of her husband.</p>

<p>“I hain’t a-lookin’ fer comfort, Marthy,”
said the old farmer, stubbornly. “The facts
of the case is clear, an’ we’ve got tew face
’em!”</p>

<p>“Yew mean we’ve got tew leave the old
home an’ go tew the Poor Farm, I s’pose,”
was the answer. “Oh, Joshuy! It’s hard, an’
I ain’t done nothin’ tew deserve it!”</p>

<p>Joshua Marlowe arose and paced the floor
excitedly. For the first time in his life he
began to feel the twinges of a rebuking conscience.</p>

<p>Only two years before he had been a fairly
prosperous farmer, with a good wife and
three of the prettiest daughters to be found in
that section.</p>

<p>When Tom Wilders, a lean, lanky, close-fisted
farmer from his own town, asked to
marry Samantha; he gave her to him without
a word, and his eldest daughter, who inherited
her mother’s meekness, accepted him for a
husband, knowing that she loathed the fellow.</p>

<p>Only a little while after the marriage, Tom
Wilders called on the deacon. His interview
with his father-in-law was strictly private,
but in some way it cost the deacon exactly
five hundred dollars.</p>

<p>Where he got the money no one knew for a
time, but very soon Silas Johnson, another
neighbor, began suing boldly for the hand of
Dollie Marlowe.</p>

<p>Dollie was only seventeen, but she had
more spirit than Samantha, and, better yet,
she had her sister Marion to protect her.</p>

<p>For what the rest of the women of the
Marlowe family lacked in spirit, beautiful,
gray-eyed Marion made up in full. As she
grew older she developed the determination
of her father, but it was backed by honor and
good judgment, and her love for her twin sister
made her as fearless as a lion.</p>

<p>Quite by accident Marion learned of her
father’s reason for assenting to Silas Johnson’s
suit. He had given Silas a mortgage
on the farm for five hundred dollars in order
to obtain the money to loan to Tom Wilders.</p>

<p>Now, when the mortgage was to be foreclosed
and the old people turned out, Tom,
the dutiful son-in-law, not only refused to
pay up, but he also refused to even harbor his
wife’s parents.</p>

<p>There was still a mystery about the loan of
the money, but neither Mrs. Marlowe nor
Samantha dared to question their husbands,
and there was not a scrap of paper to prove
the transaction.</p>

<p>“Ef Marion wuz here, she’d sift this thing
tew the bottom,” thought poor, weak Mrs.
Marlowe, as she sat and wept, and then for,
perhaps, the first time in her life, she turned
and bitterly berated her husband.</p>

<p>“Yew’ve done it all, Joshuy!” she said,
lowering her apron. “Yew tied Samanthy
hand and foot tew the stingiest critter this
side er Jordan, an’, what’s more, yew’ve driv
both Marion and Dollie from their own father’s
door—yew’ve done it, an’ some day yew’ll
answer fer it, Joshuy!”</p>

<p>Her husband paused in his nervous pacing,
and stared at her wonderingly. There was
a red flush of shame creeping over his wrinkled
forehead.</p>

<p>“I’ve never said it before, being I ain’t
dared, but I’ll say it now ef yew kill me,
Joshuy Marlowe! I’m tew full tew keep
still! I jest can’t, an’ that’s all there is about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>it! Yew’ve been tew hard on yewr own flesh
an’ blood, an’ yew’ve been tew hard on me—an’
we air goin’ tew the Poor Farm as a
jedgement upon us—yew fer bein’ so hard,
an’ me fer keepin’ still an’ mindin’ ye!”</p>

<p>Before such a flood of honest condemnation,
Joshua Marlowe stood silent; he had not
dreamed that his wife harbored such bitterness
toward him.</p>

<p>With hardly a pause for breath, she went
on speaking, rolling the corners of her apron
in both hands and rocking her body back and
forth in the torrent of her misery.</p>

<p>“Ef it warn’t fer yewr hardness, they
would be here now, Joshuy—Samanthy, Marion
an’ Dollie! But yew turned ’em out!
Yew did, Joshuy Marlowe! Yew giv Samanthy
tew Tom an’ disowned poor Dollie, an’
yew’d a-turned Marion out ef yew’d a-dared,
but yew dassent! That’s one of yewr children
that wasn’t afeard of yew, Joshuy! Oh,
Marion! Marion! I wish yew wuz here this
minute!”</p>

<p>The poor woman clasped her hands over
her face and began weeping again, while
Joshua Marlowe stood like one transfixed,
staring grimly at her.</p>

<p>There was a light step on the snow outside,
but neither of them heard it. The next second
the door flew open and a beautiful girl
stood upon the threshold, her eyes flashing
like diamonds as their glance fell upon the
weeping woman.</p>

<p>“Mother! Mother! I have come back!”
cried a sweet, young voice.</p>

<p>The poor woman dropped her apron and
gave a scream of joy.</p>

<p>“Oh, Marion! Thank God! It is my
darter Marion!”</p>
<hr class="sect" />


<h3 title="II. PAYING OFF THE MORTGAGE">CHAPTER II.<br />

<small>PAYING OFF THE MORTGAGE.</small></h3>

<p>Without even noticing her father, Marion
Marlowe crossed the room to her mother’s
side, and for just a moment mother and
daughter wept together.</p>

<p>Joshua Marlowe stared at her silently. He
could hardly believe his eyes. Was this beautiful,
stylishly dressed girl his daughter
Marion?</p>

<p>After her burst of tears was over, Marion
dried her eyes. It was not her nature to
waste much time in weeping.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you answer our letters, mother—Dollie’s
and mine?” she asked, and then
answered her own question without waiting
for her mother.</p>

<p>“I suppose father would not let you,” she
said, with some scorn, “and of course you
were too scared to dream of disobeying him!
It doesn’t seem possible that a woman could
be so weak, but I forgive you, mother. I
know he would only have made your life miserable
for you.”</p>

<p>“Yew air tew hard on me, Marion,” said
her father, faintly. He had always stood a
little in fear of his daughter Marion.</p>

<p>The girl sprang to her feet and faced him,
her cheeks flaming with indignation.</p>

<p>“No, I’m not, father!” she said, hotly. “I
am not hard enough on you! You have
broken up your own family and you ought to
be ashamed of it!”</p>

<p>“Did I send Dollie away?” asked the
farmer, flaring up a little. “Did I make her
run away with that scapegrace, Lawson?”</p>

<p>“No, you didn’t do that, father,” said Marion,
sadly, “but you condemned and disowned
her as soon as she was gone, when you might
have known that Dollie was innocent.”</p>

<p>“Waal, any father would hev done the
same, I reck’n,” said the old man, lamely,
“but ef I did wrong, I’m a-gittin’ paid fer it,
there’s no use denyin’ that, Marion.”</p>

<p>His mood had softened and his lips were
twitching suspiciously.</p>

<p>As Marion looked at him she seemed suddenly
to realize how old and worn he was,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>and in an instant her heart was bleeding for
him.</p>

<p>“Father! Father!” she cried, going over to
him as he sank upon a chair and putting her
hand almost tenderly upon his shoulder.
“You have been hard with us all, father; but
we will forgive you! Just say that you love
us, and that in future you will be more kind.”</p>

<p>“It’s tew late, Marion,” cried the old man,
huskily. “There’s no home fer yew tew come
back tew now, so it don’t make no diff’rence
about your old father! We air goin’ tew the
Poor Farm, yewr mother an’ me, an’ I guess
she’s right—she sez it’s jedgement upon us!”</p>

<p>Marion Marlowe’s lips trembled, but only
with a smile. Her eyes shone through her
tears as she gazed steadily at her father.</p>

<p>There was something she must know before
she told them the truth about the errand
that had brought her back to the mortgaged
homestead.</p>

<p>“Father,” she began, sternly, “there is
something I must know! If you refuse to
tell me, I will never forgive you! What
scrape was Samantha’s husband in when you
loaned him that five hundred dollars? Tell
me the actual truth, father, for I am determined
to know it.”</p>

<p>Deacon Marlowe raised his head with the
old, stubborn motion that his wife and daughter
knew so well, but one look at Marion’s
face made his glance waver considerably.</p>

<p>“I can’t tell yew—it’s Tom’s secret,” he began,
but Marion interrupted him.</p>

<p>“You must tell me,” she said, firmly, “or I
will employ a detective to find out for me.”</p>

<p>Deacon Marlowe’s jaw dropped and his
cheeks became almost ashen in color. The
word detective to his country ears was synonymous
with everything that meant diabolical
cleverness.</p>

<p>“Yew wouldn’t dew that!” he began, and
stopped. There was something in Marion’s
eyes that told him plainly that she would
do it.</p>

<p>“Waal, I’ll tell ef I must,” he muttered at
last, “an’, after all, I don’t much keer, fer
Tom’s behaved mighty mean tew me. I let
him hev the money when he went tew New
York that time, an’ I reckon he lost it in some
of them hocus-pocus games—I don’t know
what they call ’em, it’s ‘bunco,’ or sumthin’!
Anyhow, he lost the money, an’ come home
with a satchel full of worthless green paper,
an’ it’s nat’ral thet neither on us wanted tew
say much about it, excep’ I had tew tell Sile,
’cause he took the mor’gage.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Marlowe stared at her husband in
breathless interest while he was talking. In
the height of her indignation she had never
dreamed that he was such a sinner.</p>

<p>As for Marion, her first thought was one
of disgust; then, the picture of her gawky
brother-in-law being “buncoed” by sharpers
rose before her mental vision, and, in spite of
herself, she burst out laughing.</p>

<p>“So you were a ‘green goods’ victim, dad!”
she cried, hysterically. “You thought, by
mortgaging the farm, you’d get rich in a minute!
Oh, it’s no wonder that city people
think we country folks are green! That’s
why they never lose a chance of imposing
upon us!”</p>

<p>“Waal, it’s did, an’ thet’s all there is about
it,” said her father, dolefully, “an’ it’s me an’
yewr mother thet’s got ter bear the brunt.
Yew an’ Dollie air free, an’ yew look prosperous,
Marion.”</p>

<p>The old man was weakening very rapidly
now. He was fast becoming meek and submissive
in his manner.</p>

<p>“We’ve had an awful struggle,” was Marion’s
slow answer. “We’ve been without
money and almost without friends, but Dollie
has got a position as typewriter in view, and
when I get back I’m to be a nurse. I’ve got
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>a letter in my pocket this minute accepting
my application.”</p>

<p>Her parents stared at her curiously, so
Marion went on. She was glad to see that
they took an interest in what she was telling
them.</p>

<p>“Yes, I applied for a dozen or more positions
during the first few weeks I was in New
York, and this morning, just as I was coming
away, I got my first acceptance. I’m to go to
Charity Hospital, on Blackwell’s Island, as
soon as I go back, and I’m just crazy to begin,
for I know I will like nursing.”</p>

<p>“But I tho’t yew wanted to be a singer,”
said her father, a little vaguely. “Yew’ve got
a bootiful voice, Marion, it’s a pity yew can’t
use it.”</p>

<p>Marion smiled at these words of praise
from her father, but did not show by a look
that she thought them surprising.</p>

<p>“I sang one night in a concert hall,” she
said, laughing. “I had no idea what the place
was like before I sang, or I would never have
done it; but I guess it didn’t hurt me, and I
made a hundred dollars.”</p>

<p>“What!” cried her father and mother, in
one breath.</p>

<p>Marion nodded her head in a knowing
manner.</p>

<p>“They offered me that every night if I
would sing,” she said, proudly; “but it was a
drinking place, and I wouldn’t do it.”</p>

<p>Deacon Marlowe was still staring at her as
though he could not believe his senses. Such
tales as this set his old brain to spinning.</p>

<p>“Everything that is wicked pays well in
New York,” said Marion, sadly; “but it’s another
thing when you are honest and want to
live decently.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Marlowe began weeping again, this
time very quietly.</p>

<p>“Tew think what we have come tew,” she
moaned, behind her apron. “Our two daughters
in a big, wicked city a-tryin’ tew earn
their livin’, an’ yew an’ me, Joshuy, a-goin’
tew leave the old home an’ go tew the Poor
Farm, an’ it’s all on account of yewr hardness
an’ overbearin’—it’s all yewr fault, Joshuy!”</p>

<p>Marion stopped her before she could go
any farther.</p>

<p>“See here, mother,” she said, brightly,
“things ain’t quite so bad as you think! In
fact, what do you suppose I’ve come back for,
if it isn’t to help you?”</p>

<p>“What, yew help a father that’s been so
hard on yew!” sobbed the woman.</p>

<p>“Yew come back to help me, Marion?”
gasped her astonished father.</p>

<p>Marion slowly drew a roll of bills from
the purse in her hand and laid it on her
mother’s lap before she answered.</p>

<p>“You’ve been hard on us, father, but we
forgive you,” she said, gently. “I saved a
little girl’s life in New York a day or two
ago, and her mother was so grateful that she
rewarded me handsomely. There’s five hundred
dollars to pay off the mortgage, father,
and all I want you to say is that you forgive
your little Dollie!”</p>

<p>There was a noble light shining from Marion’s
eyes. As the old farmer looked up at
her he burst out crying.</p>
<hr class="sect" />


<h3 title="III. A POOR WIFE’S DETERMINATION">CHAPTER III.<br />

<small>A POOR WIFE’S DETERMINATION.</small></h3>

<p>It was almost train time when Marion left
her father and mother, now radiantly happy
in the little farmhouse kitchen. As she
walked briskly along the rough, frozen road
to the station the young girl’s face was fairly
glowing with pleasure. She had saved her
sister Dollie, and now she had saved the old
home. She could hardly believe it seemed
possible that she was still Marion Marlowe.</p>

<p>“Just a simple little country girl,” she whispered
to herself. “Why, only a few months
ago I was driving the cows down this very
road and wearing a calico dress and a gingham
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>sunbonnet.” She looked down at her
neat cloth dress and her soft fur collar and
muff, and a smile of content crossed her
beautiful features.</p>

<p>“It has been a hard struggle, but I am sure
it is nearly over now!” she sighed. “Oh, I
shall win fame and fortune yet, I feel sure
that I shall! All it needs is the three Ps—‘patience,
pluck and perseverance.’”</p>

<p>She was just passing the gate of an old red
farmhouse now, and her eyes wandered a little
curiously over the familiar premises.</p>

<p>“Silas Johnson’s farm,” she said, aloud.
“Oh, I wonder if he is kind to the poor, unfortunate
girl that he married!”</p>

<p>Almost as if in answer, a young girl came
running down the path. Marion recognized
her at once. It was Sallie Green, her old
playmate.</p>

<p>“Oh, Marion! Marion! How do you do!”
cried Sallie. “I knew you in a minute in spite
of your lookin’ so stylish!”</p>

<p>Marion put her arms around the girl and
kissed her tenderly.</p>

<p>Sallie was pale and thin, and even homelier
than ever.</p>

<p>“Oh, Marion! This life is awful!” she said,
as soon as she could speak. “It is killing me
to live with Sile! You have no idea how
cross he is, now that he’s got me where he
can boss me!”</p>

<p>“But don’t let him ‘boss’ you!” said the
young girl, quickly. “Have some will of
your own, Sallie, and make him respect it!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I can’t! I can’t!” sobbed Sallie, dolefully.
“He’d kill me, I believe, he’s so almighty
spiteful! He wasn’t so bad at first,
but it’s awful now. Why, sometimes, Marion,
I believe he just hates me!”</p>

<p>“It’s dreadful!” said Marion; “but I don’t
see how you can help it. You were weak and
foolish enough to marry him, and now you’ll
have to suffer forever unless you can summon
up the courage to rise above it.”</p>

<p>“I’ll run away, that’s what I’ll do,” said
Sallie, sullenly. “I’ll run away like Dollie
did and go to the city.”</p>

<p>“Hush!” said Marion, sharply. “You must
not say that, Sallie! Dollie did not run away
of her own free will. She was hypnotized
and abducted by the fellow Lawson! Oh, you
have no idea what a terrible experience she
had; but I rescued her, and now she has a
position. She is to be typewriter in a lawyer’s
office.”</p>

<p>Poor Sallie Johnson looked at her in perfect
bewilderment.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t I do that?” she asked, rather stupidly.</p>

<p>“It requires a great deal of practice,” said
Marion, kindly. “I am afraid you would not
have time to learn, even if you had a machine;
but I must hurry, Sallie, it is time I was at
the station.”</p>

<p>Sallie’s eyes were full of tears as Marion
kissed her.</p>

<p>“I’ll run away some day, you can be sure
of it, Marion,” she repeated. “I jest hate
Silas Johnson, and I won’t stand him much
longer! I’ll either kill myself or run away
to the city.”</p>

<p>“Don’t! Don’t!” was all that Marion had
time to say. “Try to bear it, Sallie. Perhaps
things will get better.”</p>

<p>There was a distant shriek of an engine
whistle, and Marion fled down the street. It
was the last train to the city, and she had to
catch it or remain in Hickorytown until another
day.</p>

<p>Just as she reached the little station a burly
form confronted her, and the coarse voice of
Matt Jenkins, the keeper of the Hickorytown
Poor Farm, growled a word of greeting.</p>

<p>“Been up to visit the old folks, I s’pose,”
he said, sneeringly. “Waal, it’s well you
came now, fer they won’t be long at the homestead.
They’ll be a boardin’ with me at the
Poor Farm in a week or so.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>
<p>“Are you sure?” asked Marion, coldly, as
she turned away from him.</p>

<p>“Waal, five hundred-dollar bills don’t grow
on bushes,” he said, sneeringly, “an’ if Sile
Johnson don’t get his money, he’ll turn ’em
out the first day of Janooary.”</p>

<p>“Silas Johnson is a brute!” said Marion,
sharply.</p>

<p>“’Tain’t sweetened his nature any tew marry
Sal,” said Matt Jenkins, coarsely, “fer,
with all her shortcomin’s, he’d ruther hev
married Dollie.”</p>

<p>Marion turned her back on him without a
word. The train was approaching, she could
see the headlight in the distance.</p>

<p>“Bert Jackson got killed—s’pose yew heerd
of it,” said Jenkins, in her ear. “I reckin he
got tew smart with them cable cars—thet’s
usually the end of country boys and gals thet
think they’re smart enough tew git on in the
city.”</p>

<p>“Bert was the smartest boy that the Poor
Farm ever held,” said Marion, suddenly,
turning square around. “I helped him to run
away from the Poor Farm that night, and I
only wish that I could help them all to get
away from your cruel treatment, Matt Jenkins.”</p>

<p>“Bert wouldn’t hev been killed if he’d
stayed at the farm,” was the answer; “fer I
ain’t so good ter my boys—I only half kill
’em.”</p>

<p>Marion sprang aboard of the train almost
before it stopped, and as she took her seat
she was shaking with laughter.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t he be mad if he knew the truth,”
she was thinking. “Why, if Matt Jenkins
knew that Bert was alive and in a good position,
I believe he’d be so mad that he would
chew nails for a fortnight.”</p>

<p>A ripple of laughter flowed from Marion’s
lips. She was so amused at her thoughts
that she entirely forgot her surroundings.</p>

<p>“By Jove! But that’s a pretty girl!” said
a low voice just behind her. Marion sobered
instantly, but did not turn around. She knew
that the gentleman who had spoken did not
intend that she should hear him.</p>

<small>A SERIOUS MATCHMAKER.</small></h3>
</div>
<p>When Marion alighted from her train at
the Grand Central Depot it was almost midnight,
but she was not frightened a particle.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t seem much like the first time I
came,” she said to the gentleman and lady
who sat just behind her and who had been
talking to her pleasantly during the last part
of the journey.</p>

<p>“How so?” asked the gentleman, with an
interested look.</p>

<p>“Why, I was as green as grass,” said Marion,
laughing. “I had on a homespun frock
and a simple little straw hat, and it was my
very first glimpse of a real city. You can’t
imagine how lonesome I felt. And then, do
you know, I did not have a friend to meet me,
while to-night my sister will be here as well
as a dear friend who lives with us.”</p>

<p>“Do tell us your name,” said the lady, as
they walked slowly down the platform in the
long line of passengers.</p>

<p>“Marion Marlowe,” said the young girl,
promptly, “and here is my address,” she said,
handing her a slip of paper; “but after Monday
I shall be on Blackwell’s Island. I am
going there as a nurse—‘on probation,’ of
course—at Charity Hospital.”</p>

<p>“Then I may see you again, because I go
there often,” said the lady, quickly. “My
name is Mrs. Brookes, and I am a member of
a mission that visits the Island regularly.”</p>

<p>“And as I am to be a physician, I may see
you, too,” said the gentleman, smiling. “I
am Reginald Brookes, a student at the ‘P. and
S.’ This lady is my mother, and at present I
am a bachelor.”</p>

<p>Both ladies laughed, and they all shook
hands.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>
<p>The next moment Marion spied Dollie and
her friend, Miss Allyn, and the three girls
were soon together.</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ve found the cunningest little flat
you ever saw, Marion,” said Dollie, as the
girls were disrobing in their room a little
later, “and Miss Allyn and I are to keep house
together, and there’s to be a bed for you
whenever you can get away from the Island.”</p>

<p>“It’s a hard place to get away from,” said
Miss Allyn, smiling; “but as you are only to
go up for three months, Marion, I suppose
there’s some use in keeping a bed for you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I hope I’ll stay longer than that,”
laughed Marion. “Why, I’d hate to be sent
away when my probationary term was over.
I’d almost be tempted to commit some crime
that would send me back——”</p>

<p>Miss Allyn was a newspaper reporter
who had been their dearest friend ever since
the girls began their search for work in the
big city. She was not as beautiful as the
two country girls, but she made up in wisdom
what she lacked in beauty.</p>

<p>“You are our encyclopedia, directory, almanac
and family guide,” Marion had told
her, but Miss Allyn was too modest to admit
her worth. She was one of the few who
could do favors without becoming obtrusively
patronizing. Dollie Marlowe was eager to
hear about her sister’s visit to their parents,
and her blue eyes filled with tears as Marion
told them all about it, for in spite of her
father’s hardness, and her mother’s weakness,
she was still their child and loved her
parents dearly.</p>

<p>When Marion told them of poor Sallie,
Dollie was terribly grieved. She sympathized
so deeply with the girl that she became
almost hysterical.</p>

<p>“I suppose that is exactly the way Sile
would have treated me if I had married
him,” she cried, with her blue eyes blazing.
“Oh, Marion, if Sallie had only had a sister
like you, she would never have been weak
enough to marry Silas!”</p>

<p>“Sallie was a poor, foolish girl,” said Marion,
sadly, “and for that very reason Silas
abuses her now.”</p>

<p>“I think a girl is a fool to marry a man
she doesn’t love,” said Miss Allyn, sharply,
“particularly when he has no money and she
doesn’t even respect him!”</p>

<p>“So do I,” said Marion, stoutly, “but Sallie
did not know any better. She’s just like
dozens of other women—she has never done
any thinking. Why, Alma, some of the women
in the country are a different order of
beings from you city women. They think
that marrying is the only end and aim of existence.”</p>

<p>“Poor things! I pity them, and I despise
them, too,” said Miss Allyn, sadly. “There
is no excuse for such reasoning at this stage
of the world’s progress. There are so many
fields of usefulness for a woman to-day.”</p>

<p>“Well, I am glad that Dollie and I are
safely out of the rut,” said Marion, thankfully.
“We’ve got a chance to develop and see
something of the world before we marry
and settle down.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but I’m going to marry some day,”
said Dollie, merrily, as she clambered into
bed and placed her pretty plump arms above
her head. “Ralph says he won’t wait very
long after he is able to support me.”</p>

<p>“I’ll have to scold Ralph a little,” said
Marion, pinching her sister’s dimpled arm
as it lay on the pillow. “He must not be in
such a hurry to rob me of my sister, not that
I blame him a bit, do you?” she added,
laughing.</p>

<p>“Not a bit,” said Miss Allyn, quickly.
“I’m half in love with her myself. Still, I’d
rather she’d marry a millionaire, and she
could do it just as easily. Ralph Moore is
all right, but he’s too poor for Dollie.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Miss Allyn!” cried both girls in half
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>serious horror. “Who ever would have
dreamed of you harboring such sentiments?”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve got ’em, and I might as well
be honest,” was the answer. “Dollie’s too
pretty to have to spend her life in a poor
man’s home. I want to see diamonds in her
golden hair and fine lace on those white
shoulders, and I don’t see why she can’t
love a rich man as well as a poor one.”</p>

<p>“If she could it would be all right, and I
would agree with you,” said Marion,
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll never love any one but Ralph,”
said Dollie, stoutly, “and I don’t care if he is
poor. It just makes me love him still the
harder.”</p>

<p>“You are a brave little kitten,” said Marion,
smoothing the golden hair, “but what
is it, Alma, you look so terribly serious?”</p>

<p>Miss Allyn was just raising her hand to
turn off the gas for the girls before going to
her own room, but she waited long enough
to make a candid statement.</p>

<p>“I know a young man that would make a
lovely husband for one of you girls,” she
said, slowly. “He’s an only child, and he’s
as rich as Crœsus.”</p>

<p>“Who is he?” asked Marion, half rising
on her pillow.</p>

<p>Miss Allyn turned off the gas before she
answered.</p>

<p>“His name is Reginald Brookes, and he
is a medical student. He’s exactly the kind
of a man you should marry.”</p>
<hr class="sect" />


<h3 title="V. MISS ALLYN’S SECRET">CHAPTER V.<br />

<small>MISS ALLYN’S SECRET.</small></h3>

<p>Marion never quite knew what kept her
silent after Miss Allyn had mentioned the
name of Reginald Brookes, but she allowed
her friend to leave the room without saying
a word, although she had news that would
have interested both of her companions
greatly.</p>

<p>“I am surprised that she did not see him
at the depot,” she thought, as she lay silently
beside Dollie, “but I guess they left too
quickly.”</p>

<p>For an hour after that Marion’s mind
wandered restlessly. It had been an exciting
day as well as a painful one. She rehearsed
over and over the scene in the old
kitchen—her parents’ grief when she first
saw them and their rejoicing later.</p>

<p>The glimpse of the old home had stirred
memories of her childhood, but it had also
brought back all the old loathing for country
life and made her wondrously contented
with her present surroundings.</p>

<p>“Poor Sallie! How I pity her!” she exclaimed,
then listened breathlessly to see if
she had awakened Dollie.</p>

<p>“The dear child! How happy she is in her
love for Ralph!” she mused. “Well, if she
loves him and he is kind to her, what does it
matter? After all, it is one’s happiness that
is to be considered first. Oh, I wonder if I
shall ever be really and truly happy?” Then,
strangely enough, two faces appeared suddenly
before her mind. They were both
handsome, both young, and both fired with
manly purpose, and peculiarly enough, they
were both of men who possessed great riches.</p>

<p>The first picture was that of a tall young
man, with dark, trusting eyes and a tender
smile that was almost irresistible.</p>

<p>The other was of a blonde, with bright,
laughing blue eyes, yet with a frankness and
alertness of expression which won one’s confidence
immediately.</p>

<p>The first picture was that of an old friend
who was now abroad—Mr. Archibald Ray,
the young man who had aided her in her
search for Dollie. The other was that of
Reginald Brookes, the medical student—the
one whom her friend, Miss Allyn, had said
was just the kind of a man that she should
marry.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>
<p>When the girls awoke the next morning
they were as happy as larks. There was so
much to be talked over in regard to their
plans for the future.</p>

<p>Miss Allyn went downtown to her work,
early, as usual, but she astonished the girls
by coming in at noon and bringing a tall,
dark gentleman with her.</p>

<p>“My <i>fiancé</i>, Mr. Colebrook,” she said, with
a deep blush. “You must forgive me, girls,
but I could not tell you any sooner.”</p>

<p>“Oh, how perfectly lovely!” cried Dollie,
giving her a hug. “To think that you, too,
are in love, and we never even guessed it!”</p>

<p>Marion smiled as cordially as possible as
she greeted Mr. Colebrook, but there was
something about him that repelled her
strangely.</p>

<p>Once before in her life she had experienced
the same sensation, and as she thought
of it now she could feel herself becoming
awkward and embarrassed.</p>

<p>“We are on our way to a matinee,” said
Miss Allyn, hurriedly, “but I could not resist
the temptation of just bringing him in
and introducing him.”</p>

<p>“We are ever so glad you did,” said Dollie,
so cordially that Marion’s hesitating
manner passed unnoticed for the time.</p>

<p>Miss Allyn’s every expression spoke of
confidence in her lover. She looked at him
shyly, but with such trust in her glance that
to Marion she hardly seemed like the same
little woman.</p>

<p>“How she does love him!” cried Dolly, the
moment they had gone.</p>

<p>Marion still said nothing, but bit her lips
savagely. She was wondering why her
friend’s <i>fiancé</i> should have pressed her hand
so tenderly when he said good-by at parting.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Marion? You look
so glum!” said Dollie, after a minute. She
had been dusting the room, while Marion
put the dressing case in order.</p>

<p>“I don’t like that man, that Mr. Colebrook,”
said Marion, slowly. “I hope I may
be wrong, but I don’t trust him, Dollie.”</p>

<p>Dollie dropped her duster and gave a little
cry. “Oh, Marion, don’t say that!” she
exclaimed. “You are so keen in your intuitions,
and read people so cleverly that I
shall begin this moment to tremble for
Alma.”</p>

<p>“Well, I hope I am mistaken,” was Marion’s
answer. “But, nevertheless, I shall
keep an eye on him whenever I can, for I
have never felt such a dreadful feeling at
sight of a person unless there was something
about them that wasn’t trustworthy.”</p>

<p>“I know,” said Dollie, sadly, “you felt that
way about Mr. Lawson. Oh, if you had
only acted upon your first impulse with our
rascally boarder I might never have fallen
into his clutches, Marion.”</p>

<p>“I hope this fellow isn’t a hypnotist like
Mr. Lawson,” said Marion, slowly, “but
there’s one thing sure—he has cast a spell
over Miss Allyn. He’s made her love him,
and I call that wonderful.”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose he is rich,” said Dollie,
remembering Miss Allyn’s conversation the
evening before.</p>

<p>“Did you notice her eyes?” asked Marion,
sagely. “Why, that girl is so much in love
with him she doesn’t even think about it.
I’d be willing to declare she’s forgotten that
there is such a thing as money—and to think
of her reading us such a lecture on finance!”</p>

<p>Both girls laughed heartily, but Marion’s
smile ended in a sigh.</p>

<p>She was not able to shake off her impression
of Mr. Colebrook.</p>

<p>“Hello! Can I come in?” called a voice
outside the door.</p>

<p>Dollie opened it quickly and admitted a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>youth of seventeen, frank-faced and healthy
and brimming over with good nature.</p>

<p>“Oh, Bert, is that you?” called Marion,
quickly. “Come right in, so I can tell you
all about my visit to the country.”</p>

<p>“Have they erected a headstone to my
memory in the Poor Farm graveyard yet?”
asked the boy, “and is the village of Hickorytown
draped in mourning for my decease?”</p>

<p>“No, neither,” said Marion, laughing,
“but they all think you are dead, Bert. That
letter of mine to Matt Jenkins, telling him of
your death, was accepted by them all, in
spite of the made-up signature.”</p>

<p>“You did me a big favor when you wrote
that letter, Marion,” said Bert, quickly,
“and I’ll never forget it if I live to be a
hundred; but see here, I’ve got some news
for you that will make your eyes stick out!
There is a personal in the paper for Ila de
Parloa, the singer.”</p>

<p>He held out a scrap of paper toward Marion
as he spoke, and the girl’s face flushed
and paled alternately as she read it.</p>

<p>“A manager of some theatrical troupe
wants my address,” she said to Dollie. “He
tried to get it from the manager of that concert
hall where I sang, but old Vandergrift
was so mad that he wouldn’t give it to him.”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet there’s lots of them that want you,
and that will give you a good price, too,
Marion,” said Bert Jackson, eagerly. “If
you say so, I’ll look this up and see what
there is in it.”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute—let me think,” said the
fair girl, slowly; then she shook her head
with a decided motion. “No, I will not listen
to their offers at present,” she said, emphatically.
“I am to enter Charity Hospital
as a nurse next Monday. It is a noble profession,
and I feel, some way, that I am
called to it.”</p>
<hr class="sect" />


<h3 title="VI. TESTING A LOVER">CHAPTER VI.<br />

<small>TESTING A LOVER.</small></h3>

<p>Marion had ample opportunity to observe
George Colebrook in the next two days, for
Miss Allyn was furnishing her little flat,
and her <i>fiancé</i> was assiduous in his attentions
to her.</p>

<p>“I’m a little puzzled about George,” Miss
Allyn confided to Marion as they were busily
arranging and rearranging the new furniture.</p>

<p>Dollie was out in the little kitchen making
some tea, so Marion knew instinctively
that Miss Allyn had something on her mind
that she did not wish any one else to know
about. She looked at her inquiringly, and
with so much sympathy in her face that Alma
Allyn stopped in her work and came over and
stood by her.</p>

<p>“You think I’m a fool for being so much
in love, don’t you, Marion?” she asked,
smilingly. “Well, let me tell you how it
was; George and I were children together.
He wasn’t a very good boy, and I suppose I
sympathized with him. He was always in
some scrape or other, and everybody was
down on him. Well, when we grew up there
was no one else. George made love to me,
and I let him, but then we were too poor to
think of marrying. When mother died and
I went home to her funeral, I found him
there. We had then been separated two
years, but had corresponded regularly. Almost
immediately after the funeral he asked
me to marry him, and I was so utterly lonely
that I accepted him thoughtlessly. Not that
I didn’t love him, Marion, for I did love him
dearly. Someway he grew into my life and
seems almost a part of it.”</p>

<p>“And do you trust him, Alma?” asked
Marion, as she paused. “Are you sure that
he will treat you right and be a good husband
to you?”</p>

<p>Alma Allyn’s face clouded a little as she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>made her reply. In spite of her great love,
she was still able to reason.</p>

<p>“I did trust him when I promised to marry
him,” she said, slowly, “but something
has happened since that is puzzling me, Marion.
George is not the same man that he was
at mother’s funeral.”</p>

<p>Marion’s lips framed a question that she
did not ask. There was no need to ask it,
for Miss Allyn was already answering it instinctively.</p>

<p>“He wanted me to marry him as soon as
he got back from England, where he had to
go on business, he said, and that is why I
decided to take this flat with Dollie, but in
the last two days he has changed his mind.
He is not going to England, yet he says
nothing about our marriage.”</p>

<p>Marion bit her lips and thought quietly
for a moment. She could see that her friend
was suffering, and she dreaded to say anything
that would add to her sorrow.</p>

<p>“He may be undecided,” she said at last,
“or perhaps he is planning something different,
Alma, but if I were in your place, I
would come right out and ask him.”</p>

<p>Miss Allyn was a trifle pale when she
spoke again, and it was plain to Marion
that she had doubts of her lover.</p>

<p>“If I thought he did not love me, I would
release him at once,” she said, quietly, “but
he has professed to love me for years, so
why should I doubt him?”</p>

<p>“There is no reason why you should,” said
Marion, firmly. “It is very probable that
he is just waiting for something, some business
matter or affair of some kind before
he says anything.”</p>

<p>“Well, I hope it will soon be settled, for
this suspense is mighty unpleasant, I can
tell you,” said Miss Allyn, smiling a little.
“Why, for the first time in my life, Marion,
I’m not fit to attend to business.”</p>

<p>“Love affairs are dreadful things,” said
Marion, trying to laugh it over. “I’m so
glad that up to date I have never been affected.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m not so sure,” said Miss Allyn,
more gayly. “You were pretty sweet on Mr.
Ray, and you may as well own it, and, by the
way, is he coming back to this country ever?”
she asked.</p>

<p>“They are to sail next week, he and
Adele,” was the answer, “but I shall be in
the hospital then, so I suppose I can’t see
them.”</p>

<p>“Love will find the way,” quoted Miss
Allyn, slyly. “You can trust that Mr. Ray
to find you, Marion.”</p>

<p>Dollie entered just then, evidently in a
state of great excitement.</p>

<p>“Oh, girls!” she screamed, half crying,
“I’m just frightened to death. I’ve broken
my hand glass into a thousand pieces.”</p>

<p>“That means seven years of bad luck,”
said Miss Allyn, laughing; “and a half a
dollar to buy a new hand glass.”</p>

<p>“Never mind, Dollie,” said Marion, who
was not at all superstitious. “You’ll be
earning six dollars a week after this, so it
won’t take long to buy the new glass.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but I’m to save every penny to buy
my trousseau,” said Dollie, brightening.
“You keep forgetting, Marion, that I’m going
to be married.”</p>

<p>“There is little danger of her forgetting it
while you are around, Dimples,” said Miss
Allyn, laughing. “You take pains to remind
her of it every fifteen minutes.”</p>

<p>“Here comes Mr. Colebrook,” was Dollie’s
whispered reply. “Quick, come out in the
kitchen with me, Marion, so we won’t interrupt
the lovers.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” cried Miss Allyn, as she
darted toward the kitchen. “I’ll go out there
myself and see if he misses me.”</p>

<p>Dollie followed her into the kitchen of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>little flat and closed the door softly, leaving
Marion alone in their pretty parlor.</p>

<p>“Oh, all alone, Miss Marlowe,” was Mr.
Colebrook’s greeting. “Well, for once in
my life I am deucedly lucky.”</p>

<p>Marion looked up in surprise, but controlled
her feelings wonderfully. It had
popped into her head to test her friend’s
lover a little.</p>

<p>“Why do you think yourself lucky in finding
me alone,” she asked, archly, as she
went on arranging the furniture.</p>

<p>“Because you are the sweetest girl that I
ever met,” was the astonishing reply, “and
I am lucky in having a chance to say so.”</p>

<p>For a moment Marion could hardly believe
her ears; then a great feeling of pity
for Miss Allyn swept through her every
fibre.</p>

<p>Almost involuntarily she glanced toward
the kitchen door, but it was tightly closed,
so she breathed a little more freely.</p>

<p>“Miss Marlowe—Marion,” cried Mr.
Colebrook, suddenly, “have you no eyes to
see how much I admire you? Why, I’ve
been crazy with admiration ever since I met
you. You are as beautiful as a saint, and I
am desperately in love with you.”</p>

<p>Poor Marion’s breath came with a little
gasp now. It was almost impossible for a
girl with her honest nature to grasp such a
situation. Here was her best friend’s betrothed
husband actually making love to her.
He had the open assurance to tell her that
he loved her.</p>

<p>As she stood almost paralyzed by her emotions,
he seized her hand in both his own,
and before she could stop him he had kissed
it fervently.</p>

<p>Suddenly one word issued from the pale
girl’s lips.</p>

<p>“Traitor!”</p>

<p>She hissed it out slowly, her tone tense
and vibrating.</p>

<p>The fellow drew back as if he had been
stung.</p>

<p>The next instant Alma Allyn opened the
kitchen door and stepped calmly between
them.</p>
<hr class="sect" />


<h3 title="VII. MARION RECEIVES A CALLER">CHAPTER VII.<br />

<small>MARION RECEIVES A CALLER.</small></h3>

<p>“Thank you, Marion.”</p>

<p>This was all that Miss Allyn said as she
paused beside the two, her dearest friend
and the man who was her lover. Her face
was of a death-like pallor, and her eyes
were gleaming, but there was nothing further
to tell how terribly she was suffering.</p>

<p>With the utmost coolness she drew the
ring from her finger and was about to hand
it to him, when she changed her mind suddenly.</p>

<p>“No, I won’t give it back. I’ll keep it,”
she said, quietly. “It will be a constant reminder
of a man’s perfidy. Any time when
you want the price of it let me know. You
are mean enough to ask for it,” she said,
with a shrug of her shoulders.</p>

<p>George Colebrook’s face was a study for a
moment. He looked first at one of the girls
and then at the other.</p>

<p>“You had better go,” said Miss Allyn,
coolly. “You can see that you are out of
place. My friends, like myself, despise a
traitor.”</p>

<p>With a glance of hatred toward Marion,
the fellow turned and fled.</p>

<p>The moment he was gone, Miss Allyn
dropped heavily on the sofa.</p>

<p>“It has killed her!” cried Dollie, darting
to her side.</p>

<p>“She has fainted. Bring some water,”
was Marion’s answer.</p>

<p>“It is all for the best, dear; do try and
think so,” urged Marion a few minutes later,
when Miss Allyn opened her eyes.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>
<p>Miss Allyn drew herself up slowly and
looked around.</p>

<p>“So it is all over, my dream of love,” she
said, very slowly. “Well, I guess I’ve got
spunk enough to pull me through. Where’s
that looking-glass, Dollie. I want to smash
the pieces.”</p>

<p>That was the last the girls heard of Miss
Allyn’s love affair. Her lover’s name was
buried in oblivion from that very moment.</p>

<p>If Miss Allyn grieved for him, she did not
show it, but, if anything, she became a trifle
more sad and pessimistic.</p>

<p>“It would have killed me, I know,” Dollie
told Marion in confidence. “Why, if Ralph
should deceive me, I’d commit suicide, I’m
certain.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, you’d be a little goose, that’s
all I’ve got to say,” was Marion’s answer.
“Why, any one would think to hear you,
Dollie, that Ralph was the only man in the
world worth having.”</p>

<p>“Sometimes I think he is,” said Dollie,
complacently. Her faith in her lover was
something that passed comprehension.</p>

<p>That evening both Dollie and Miss Allyn
went out, Dollie with her lover and Miss Allyn
on business. As Marion seated herself
in a big arm-chair in the semi-darkness, she
looked around their little home with a sigh
of genuine pleasure.</p>

<p>“I almost hate to leave it,” she said aloud.
“It is so sweet, so homelike and so beautifully
cosy.”</p>

<p>There was a peal of the bell just at that
very moment, which was so shrill that it
brought her to her feet in a second.</p>

<p>“Our callers are coming early,” she
thought as she went to look for the door
opener, “but everything looks cosy even if
we are not all settled.”</p>

<p>“I am looking for Miss Marion Marlowe,”
said a voice on the stairs as Marion stepped
out into the hall.</p>

<p>“I have been to her old address and they
sent me here. I wonder, if I should find her,
if she would be willing to see me?”</p>

<p>Marion’s laugh rippled out merrily at this
naive request, and she held out her hand
cordially to her unexpected caller.</p>

<p>“I am delighted to see you, Dr. Brookes,”
she said, smiling, “but I am very sorry that
both my friend and my sister are absent this
evening. They would both have stayed at
home if we had known you were coming.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I am not so difficult to entertain as
all that,” was the jolly answer. “One young
lady at a time is enough, I find, Miss Marlowe.
I am not so piggish as to want a
dozen.”</p>

<p>“They say there is safety in a multitude,”
said Marion, slyly. “No danger of falling
in love when there are plenty of them. It’s
the monopoly of one that proves fatal, they
tell me.”</p>

<p>“So you think falling in love a fatality, do
you?” asked the young man, quickly. “Well,
if that is the case, I confess that I’m a fatalist.”</p>

<p>“It has fatal consequences, I have discovered,”
said Marion, half sadly, “although I
must admit that I speak from observation
and not experience.”</p>

<p>“A confession that I am glad to hear you
make, Miss Marlowe,” said her caller almost
seriously; “for most of the women that men
meet nowadays are either just recovering
from some heart malady or at the actual
crisis of the disease, or else, what is worse,
they have so thoroughly recovered from some
violent attack as to render them immune
from ever having another.”</p>

<p>“Poor things! I pity them,” said Marion,
laughing, “but I can fancy that none of the
three classes would afford very desirable companions.
Still, we are all liable to infection
of that kind,” she added, as she offered him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>a chair, “and up to the present time no one
has produced a preventive.”</p>

<p>“No, nor an antidote,” was the answer, in
the same serious voice, “but now tell me,
Miss Marlowe, about your plans for the future.”</p>

<p>He spoke with so much sympathetic interest
that Marion did not dream of resenting
it; rather, it seemed most natural for
her to sit there and tell him all about her
plans.</p>

<p>He was to be a physician and she a nurse.
They had many hopes and aspirations in
common.</p>

<p>The evening passed so quickly that Marion
was astonished when at ten o’clock the
young man rose to leave her.</p>

<p>“I shall arrange to come over to Charity
often,” he said at parting. “I know several
of the doctors there, so I can do so easily.”</p>

<p>“I hope I shall like it,” said Marion, soberly.
“It seems such a noble profession to
be caring for the sick and suffering.”</p>

<p>“It is terribly hard work, though,” said
Mr. Brookes, somewhat discouragingly, “and
I wish it was almost any other hospital than
Charity.”</p>

<p>Marion was about to reply, when she heard
Miss Allyn coming up the stairs.</p>

<p>She bit her lips with amusement as she
pictured what was about to follow.</p>

<p>She had not told either Miss Allyn or Dollie
that she knew this young man, so she
was prepared for something like a scene
from Miss Allyn.</p>

<p>“Good-night, Miss Marlowe,” said young
Brookes, holding out his hand.</p>

<p>“Good-night,” Marion answered, her lips
curving into a smile, “and I do hope you will
keep your promise about coming to Charity.”</p>

<p>“I will, indeed,” said the young man, softly.
The next moment he turned and confronted
Miss Allyn.</p>

<p>“Miss Allyn! Alma! Is it possible?” he
cried in astonishment.</p>

<p>“Hello, Reggie, what the mischief are you
doing here?” was the answer.</p>

<p>Then as Miss Allyn caught sight of Marion,
she added promptly: “Oh, I see, you
are making love to the noblest girl in creation!”</p>
<hr class="sect" />


<div class="chapter">
<h3 title="VIII. A PROPHECY CAME TRUE">CHAPTER VIII.<br />

<small>A PROPHECY CAME TRUE.</small></h3>
</div>
<p>“Well, if you are not a sly one,” remarked
Miss Allyn, as soon as she and Marion were
alone in the little parlor.</p>

<p>Marion indulged in a hearty laugh before
she told her how she had met young Brookes
and his mother on the train the day she
came back from the country.</p>

<p>“Will you take my advice and marry him
if he asks you,” said Miss Allyn, shortly.
“There are not many men like Reginald
Brookes, Marion, I can tell you.”</p>

<p>“Is he better than Mr. Ray?” asked Marion,
jokingly. “I have been trying to answer
that question for myself all the evening.”</p>

<p>“Poor Mr. Ray! His chances are fading,”
said Miss Allyn, smiling. “Well, it wouldn’t
be fair to the absent to praise his rival, so
I’ll decline the responsibility of answering
your question.”</p>

<p>“That’s just like you, Alma,” said Marion,
soberly. “You are the most loyal woman
that I ever met or heard of.”</p>

<p>“Well, I know another that answers to
that description,” said Miss Allyn, quickly.
“Do you want to see her?”</p>

<p>She grasped Marion by the shoulders and
whirled her around so that she faced the
mirror directly over the mantel.</p>

<p>Marion blushed and was about to speak,
when Dollie tapped on the door. Her lover,
Ralph Moore, was with her and begged the
girls to let him come in a minute.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>
<p>“Come right in, Brother Ralph,” said Marion,
teasingly. “Come in and see Dollie’s
new home, and I’ll introduce you to Miss
Allyn.”</p>

<p>Ralph Moore was a handsome fellow, with
charming manners, and since his engagement
to Dollie he was just like a big brother
to Marion.</p>

<p>“It’s very pretty,” he said, admiringly. “I
hope I’ll soon be able to furnish as pretty a
one for Dollie.”</p>

<p>“What, and take her away from me?”
asked Miss Allyn, quickly. “Well, that settles
it, Mr. Moore. You can consider me
your sworn enemy.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’ll have to live with us,” retorted
Dollie. “We’ll take a bigger flat and all live
together.”</p>

<p>“No, thanks,” said Miss Allyn, laughing;
“none of that for me. Do you suppose I
could stand it to see you forever spooning?”</p>

<p>After a laugh at this remark, Mr. Moore
took his departure, boldly kissing his sweetheart
in the tenderest manner.</p>

<p>“Good-by, Ralph,” said Marion. “I will
not see you again. I have an engagement
to-morrow night, and Monday I go to the
Island.”</p>

<p>“Well, good luck, Sister Marion,” said
Ralph, taking her hand; then he turned toward
Dollie with a pleading expression.</p>

<p>“Yes, you can kiss her, seeing it’s Marion,”
said Dollie, laughing, “but just look
out for yourself, sir. If I ever catch you kissing
any other girl, why, I’d just scratch your
eyes out, even if I do love you.”</p>

<p>“I won’t take any chances,” said Ralph, in
mock terror; then he kissed Marion good-by
and said good night to Miss Allyn.</p>

<p>“A mighty fine fellow,” was Miss Allyn’s
comment.</p>

<p>“A noble young man,” was Marion’s answer.
“We can never forget how loyally he
has defended us.”</p>

<p>Miss Allyn knew what she meant, and
nodded her head. She had heard the story
of Ralph Moore’s strange deed, how he had
appropriated a jewel from his aunt and
pawned it to keep the girls from starvation.</p>

<p>“I’d trust a man like that anywhere,” she
said, slowly, “for no matter what he did, no
one would suffer by it; he would look at
both sides of a brook before he jumped it.”</p>

<p>The girls were soon in bed and sound
asleep. They had had a tiresome day, but
would have been absolutely happy had not
the unfaithfulness of Miss Allyn’s lover cast
a cloud upon their thoughts.</p>

<p>Early Monday morning Marion said good-by
to her friend and to her sister, for Miss
Allyn and Dollie were going down town together,
as it was Dollie’s first day of service
as a typewriter.</p>

<p>At ten o’clock Marion started out. Her
boat left at eleven from the East Twenty-sixth
street dock, and she had a permit in
her pocket which the clerk at Charity Hospital
had sent her.</p>

<p>It was to be a strange experience, and
Marion trembled a little. Some way she
dreaded to see the sights that she was about
to encounter.</p>

<p>“There are prisoners and crazy people of
all kinds up there,” she whispered to herself.
“I just dread to face such misery, and yet
some one has to do it.”</p>

<p>She had packed her little trunk and sent
it on before her, so now she had nothing but
a handbag to carry, and she quite enjoyed
the ride from Harlem in the elevated train.</p>

<p>Marion had just reached the street from
the elevated station, when the sharp clang of
a bell startled her from her reflections.</p>

<p>There was a large group of people about
half way down the block, and in an instant
an ambulance came dashing around the corner.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>
<p>“A woman either sick or drunk,” said
somebody near her.</p>

<p>Marion walked along slowly, so as not to
get in the crowd which, like all New York
crowds, seemed to spring right up through
the sidewalk.</p>

<p>“Get out of the way there, will you!”
shouted a burly policeman, as he rushed up.
“Stand back there and give the doctor a
chance. Move on, I say, or I’ll club the
heads off’n you!”</p>

<p>Marion shrank back a little, but she was
the only one. The others swarmed about the
ambulance as though the officer had not
spoken.</p>

<p>In the twinkling of an eye the ambulance
swung around and a physician in uniform
sprang to the curbing.</p>

<p>The crowd fell back a little when the officer
resorted to vigorous measures, and the
next moment Marion caught sight of a woman
lying on the sidewalk, with her head
actually falling over the curb into the gutter.</p>

<p>“Run out the stretcher,” ordered the physician
as another officer arrived on the
scene. He picked the woman up bodily and
laid her on the floor of the ambulance, which
was fitted with a mattress and blankets.</p>

<p>A break in the crowd enabled her to see
clearly. In a second she was staring hard,
her breath almost choking her.</p>

<p>There was something familiar about the
woman’s dress, which was of a plain, dark
homespun, so common in the country.</p>

<p>The next moment Marion had pressed forward
until she obtained a clear view of the
poor creature’s face, and then a cry burst
from her lips that made the crowd stare at
her.</p>

<p>“It is Sallie—Sallie Green!” she cried hysterically.</p>

<p>The ambulance bell clanged and there was
a swaying of the crowd. Before she could
collect her senses the ambulance dashed off,
carrying Silas Johnson’s wretched wife to a
cot in Bellevue Hospital.</p>

<p>Sallie had kept her word—she had “run
away to the big city.”</p>
<hr class="sect" />


<h3 title="IX. MARION MEETS A MISSIONARY">CHAPTER IX.<br />

<small>MARION MEETS A MISSIONARY.</small></h3>

<p>Marion made her way down to the dock,
feeling almost dazed at what she had seen.
She was endeavoring to decide what was her
duty in the matter.</p>

<p>She heard the clang of the bell as the ambulance
dashed into Bellevue Hospital yard,
but she was too late to see more, for the
great gate closed as she reached it.</p>

<p>She took her permit from her pocket and
glanced at it eagerly. It was dated, so she
knew she must use it that day, and, furthermore,
it was now five minutes of eleven, so
there was no time to be spent in helping
Sallie.</p>

<p>“They’ll take good care of her, I am sure,”
she whispered to herself, “and, anyway, I
can write to Silas as soon as I get up there.
He can’t be so bad but what he’ll come and
get her.”</p>

<p>In less than five minutes she was on the
dock, and here for a moment Marion almost
forgot poor Sallie. There were several
policemen standing around, as if waiting
for something, and on the deck of the
<i>Thomas Brennan</i>, the ferryboat that was to
convey her to Blackwell’s Island, and which
was moored to the dock, she could see several
more men in blue uniforms waiting.</p>

<p>As soon as Marion passed the dock entrance
an officer came up to her. Marion
handed him her permit and he turned and
nodded to the captain.</p>

<p>“Go right on deck, miss. The prisoners
will stay down below,” he said, kindly, as he
led Marion over and helped her down the
gangplank.</p>

<p>Marion glanced around the boat, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>looked anything but attractive, and was soon
on the deck as the officer had directed her.</p>

<p>Just as she reached it a great covered wagon
came lumbering down to the dock.</p>

<p>“Here she comes at last! Here’s the
‘Black Maria!’” cried the captain; then he
gave some orders and at once all was activity.</p>

<p>Marion’s eyes were widely opened when
she saw what followed, for there were fourteen
prisoners in the “Black Maria,” two of
the worst ones being handcuffed together.</p>

<p>In the quickest possible manner they were
driven on to the boat, a guard standing at
each side of the gangplank to keep them
from jumping overboard.</p>

<p>As soon as they were all on, the order
was given to start, and the boat was soon
ploughing its way up the East River and
among the craft that dotted the water.</p>

<p>“Is this a strange sight for you, miss?”
asked a voice behind Marion.</p>

<p>The young girl turned quickly and confronted
an elderly woman.</p>

<p>“It is, indeed,” said Marion promptly,
“and it is about the saddest sight that I ever
dreamed of,” she added.</p>

<p>“Are you a nurse?” asked the woman
again in a courteous manner.</p>

<p>“Not yet,” answered Marion, “but I am
accepted on probation. I am on my way to
the Charity Hospital.”</p>

<p>The woman looked at her kindly, but Marion’s
gaze was wandering. She was trying
to realize her extraordinary surroundings.</p>

<p>“Those are ‘ten-day’ men,” said the
woman, as she saw Marion staring at two of
the deck hands on the steamer. “In other
words, they have been sent up for ten days
and are allowed to work on the boat.”</p>

<p>Marion opened her eyes in absolute surprise.
She had never before heard of such
an arrangement.</p>

<p>“Why, that is ever so much better than
keeping them shut up,” she said, quickly.
“Poor fellows! I am sorry for them. They
haven’t all got bad faces.”</p>

<p>“And they are not all bad; now,” said the
woman again. “I can assure you, I have
many good friends among the prisoners.”</p>

<p>Marion turned and looked at her with interest.
She seemed to be both a refined and
an intelligent person.</p>

<p>“I am a Bible reader,” said the woman,
smiling. “I visit some of the islands every
day, and my principal duty is to read the
Bible to the prisoners.”</p>

<p>Marion’s smile changed instantly into an
expression of wonderment.</p>

<p>“Do they like that, madam?” she asked, a
little bluntly.</p>

<p>“Some of them do,” said the woman, with
a peculiar laugh, “but some are very hardened.
I can hardly get them to listen.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t wonder,” said the girl, with
a heavy sigh. “I should think that some
parts of the Bible would make them feel decidedly
uncomfortable. Of course, there are
many classes of criminals,” she added, quickly.
“There are those who sin through weakness
and those who are deliberately vicious.
Then, of course, there are the others who sin
almost from necessity.”</p>

<p>The woman looked at her in a little surprise.
She had not expected so young a
girl to be so serious on this subject.</p>

<p>“The good Word comforts each of these
classes,” was her only answer. “If they are
truly sorry they will be forgiven.”</p>

<p>Marion’s next remark showed that she
was thinking more than listening.</p>

<p>“Society is all to blame,” she said, very
soberly. “If conditions were right, there
would be very few criminals, and none, I am
sure, of the last class I mentioned. If you
could only read the Bible to our lawmakers,
madam, and to the rich men and women who
are mighty and all powerful.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>
<p>The woman smiled and looked at her curiously.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you are right,” she said, after a
minute, “but we should rise above conditions
and not be slaves to them.”</p>

<p>“That is easier said than done,” said Marion,
sharply. “When a man’s strength is
deficient he is not to blame for it.”</p>

<p>“They should have prayed for strength,”
said the woman, devoutly, “and at any rate
they should not have fallen into sin. It is
their own fault that they are here doing penance
for their wickedness.”</p>

<p>“Well, I am very sorry for them, anyway,”
replied Marion, quickly, “and I sincerely
hope that you are able to comfort
them, madam. To me they look like poor
creatures who have never had half a chance.
No doubt they would all have been honest if
they could have earned decent livings.”</p>

<p>She turned abruptly on her heel and
walked away. Some way, it vexed her to
hear this woman blaming the poor creatures.</p>

<p>“Probably she was never hungry or in
want in her life,” she thought, angrily, “so
what can she know of the temptations they
have suffered?”</p>

<p>This glimpse of misery was making Marion
depressed already. The faces of the
men haunted her, they were so pinched and
eager.</p>

<p>She wandered across the boat and stood
looking over the water, her brain busy with
the problems of how to help the poor creatures.</p>

<p>The woman did not come near her and
Marion was glad of it. She wanted to be
alone and do a little hard thinking.</p>

<p>“I may be wrong in pitying them, but I
can’t help it,” she thought. “I am sure the
struggle of life has been too hard for many
of them. I suppose that woman thinks I
am a heathen, because I did not say I thought
they deserved what they were getting.”</p>

<p>A light ripple of laughter relieved her
over-strained tension and for the next few
minutes the woman was forgotten.</p>

<p>Marion watched the prisoners land, with
the guards beside them, and then as they
marched slowly toward the penitentiary, she
left the boat and started for the hospital.</p>

<p>It was all so strange, so almost alarming,
this guarding and marching, that for a minute
she felt a sense of oppression in her soul.
It was as though she were breathing the air
of a prison cell rather than the breath of
sweet liberty, which was her rightful possession.</p>

<h3 title="X. MARION’S FIRST WEEK AT CHARITY">CHAPTER X.<br />

<small>MARION’S FIRST WEEK AT CHARITY.</small></h3>

<p>In less than a week Marion began to feel
quite at home in the big hospital, whose
windows overlooked a scene of magnificence
as well as much that was less inspiring.</p>

<p>Strips of clear blue water stretched on
both sides of the island, and as Marion listened
to the thrilling tales and traditions
which have long made Hell Gate a place of
blood-curdling interest, she could hardly
turn her eyes from the far-famed danger
spot. It seemed to enthral her in some spell
of enchantment.</p>

<p>The great cities of Brooklyn and New
York made a magnificent background to the
scene. Spires towered from expensive
churches, and at sunset the plate-glass windows
of the many noble structures gave back
a glow which was almost glorious.</p>

<p>Thus the city’s grandeur and luxury was
before her eyes, while its misery was in even
closer proximity, for was she not caring for
its victims, its slaves and its outcasts in the
very wards of this isolated building?</p>

<p>“Oh, to think that such wretchedness
should exist!” she sighed over and over.
“To think that with all the wealth and luxury
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>of New York, these poor, poor creatures
should drag out such an existence!”</p>

<p>As Marion passed through the wards, her
heart was heavy within her. It was a condition
which the simple country girl had
never dreamed could exist—a condition
which she could by any possibility have imagined,
but, nevertheless, one of the saddest,
sternest, most reliable facts in the history of
the city.</p>

<p>Inside were the sick, the deformed, the
crippled. Women whom shame had driven
from the sight of the world, others whom
care, abuse, over-work and under-pay had
reduced to that condition known as invalid
vagrancy.</p>

<p>Outside, in the numerous buildings, were
other classes—criminals, “crooks,” “scapegraces”
and prodigals and careworn men
and decrepit women—paupers, homeless and
penniless at the close of life and dependent
upon what some have called a city’s “charity.”</p>

<p>It took Marion some time to grasp the
full horror of the Island. The spot was so
beautiful that it made the realization more
difficult.</p>

<p>True to her resolve, she had written at
once to Silas, and as the hours went by, she
consoled herself by thinking that Sallie must
be safely at home, unless—and here a thrill
of horror would cross her—unless she had
died in the hospital before Silas could get
the letter.</p>

<p>The thought of poor Sallie made her keenly
alive to the sufferings of the unfortunates
around her. That one glimpse of Sallie’s
white face seemed to haunt her continually.</p>

<p>Over and over she marveled at the apparent
indifference of the other nurses, and
wondered if it were possible that she, too,
would become hardened to her surroundings.</p>

<p>“I am afraid I shall become morbid,” she
said to the head nurse in her ward one day.
“I cannot drive the horrors of this Island
out of my mind for a minute. It is fortunate
for me that you keep me so busy.”</p>

<p>Miss Williams smiled sadly. She was a
sweet-faced woman.</p>

<p>“You will be obliged to grow indifferent.
It is your only safeguard,” she said, kindly.
“An over-sympathetic nurse is never very
successful.”</p>

<p>“I shall try not to show my feelings,” said
Marion, quickly. “I know that would be
fatal to success, Miss Williams, but I am
almost certain that I can never help feeling.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but that is different,” was the cordial
answer. “A nurse that cannot feel is
a mere machine. She will do her work well,
and to some patients this will be quite satisfactory,
but to others, to the majority,
sympathy is more than medicine. An encouraging
word, or a kindly interest will
heal the soul, which is often more stricken
than the body. There is Katie B——,” she
went on more softly. “Just see how that
child hungers for a mother’s voice, yet she
is a mother herself, the poor unfortunate. A
nurse who would be cold to her would lose
the child’s confidence altogether.”</p>

<p>“I understand you perfectly,” said Marion,
slowly. “A nurse in Charity Hospital
has something to do besides make beds and
give medicines. She has human hearts to
cheer and strengthen. Oh, I hope I may be
wise enough not to throw away my opportunity.”</p>

<p>“You are doing nobly,” said Miss Williams,
smiling. “I have seldom seen a ‘probationer’
take so kindly to her lot. Making
beds and cleaning wards is not very
pleasant work, but we all had to do it before
we could wear strings to our aprons.”</p>

<p>Both girls laughed pleasantly at this allusion
to future honors, for even Marion had
learned that a nurse’s highest ambition was
to wear an honorable graduate’s cap and
apron.</p>

<p>“I shall be glad when my probation is
ended,” said Marion, eagerly. “I do so want
to wear the regulation uniform. Of course,
I am willing to admit that I don’t like to do
drudgery, but I remember that all have to
start at the beginning, and it won’t be long
before I can wield the temperature thermometer.”</p>

<p>Miss Williams sighed, and her face saddened
for a minute.</p>

<p>“You will find that the responsibility has
increased wonderfully by that time,” she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>said, slowly. “Sometimes I wish that I
could always have been a ‘probationer.’”</p>

<p>The girls were busy in the medicine-room
of the ward as they talked. Miss Williams
was getting out lint and bandages for a
coming operation, while Marion was busy
cleaning a number of surgical instruments.</p>

<p>“I feel more like a scullery maid than I do
like a nurse,” she said, laughing, as she carefully
polished some knives and arranged
them in the case.</p>

<p>“There’s your bell,” said Miss Williams,
quickly, as she heard a soft tinkle. Marion
dropped her cloth and started toward her
patient.</p>

<p>“Miss Marlowe!”</p>

<p>Miss Williams raised her voice, but spoke
gently and pleasantly.</p>

<p>“Please pick up your cloth and lay it on
the table, then move swiftly, but more silently
as you go to your patient!”</p>

<p>She smiled as she spoke, and Marion nodded
gratefully.</p>

<p>“I see I am much too impulsive,” she said,
regretfully. “Oh, will I ever learn to discipline
my emotions?”</p>

<p>“Of course you will,” said Miss Williams,
as she passed out of the door. “You’ll learn
anything that you wish to, Miss Marion
Marlowe.”</p>

<p>It was Kittie B—— who had rung the
bell. She was lying in bed, her face as white
as her pillow, with a tiny red-faced infant
nestling beside her.</p>

<p>“May I have a drink of water?” she whispered,
with a faint smile. “I guess I am
feverish—I’m awful thirsty.”</p>

<p>“Certainly you shall have it, dear,” was
Marion’s prompt answer. Then it suddenly
occurred to her that she had no right to
promise anything.</p>

<p>“I’ll have to ask Miss Williams first,
though, Kittie,” she said, quietly; “but I
guess there is no doubt but what you can
have the water.”</p>

<p>It was only a minute before Marion returned
with the water, but the request had
brought Miss Williams promptly to the bedside.</p>

<p>In a moment the trained nurse was feeling
Kittie’s pulse. In another minute the
temperature thermometer was out, and it
was discovered that Kittie had a fever.</p>

<p>“The maternity ward is not the place for
fevers,” said Miss Williams to Marion when
they were out of hearing of the patient.
“Put the screen around Kittie’s bed and keep
her as quiet as possible. If the baby annoys
her or she annoys the baby, take it out and
put it in the crib beside the bed. I will look
at her again in fifteen minutes.”</p>

<p>Marion went back to the bed and found
Kittie fidgeting. There was a look in her
face that frightened Marion somewhat.</p>

<p>She took the baby up and laid it in the
crib, then turned to soothe Kittie with a
smile and a few encouraging words.</p>

<p>The flush of fever was rising to the sick
girl’s pale face now, so that even Marion’s
untrained eye could observe and study the
symptoms.</p>

<p>She bathed her brow and moistened her
lips, but the fire in the girl’s veins seemed
to burn hotter and hotter.</p>

<p>An hour later and Miss Williams had
called the house physician to the bedside.</p>

<p>Kittie was moaning softly and turning her
head from side to side.</p>

<p>“It’s a pity we did not know more about
her when she came,” said Dr. Hall as he
turned away. “The girl is in a very dangerous
condition.”</p>
<hr class="sect" />


<h3 title="XI. SOME SHOCKING INCIDENTS">CHAPTER XI.<br />

<small>SOME SHOCKING INCIDENTS.</small></h3>

<p>The next two days were busy ones for
Marion, for she was almost constantly at
the bedside of poor, delirious Kittie.</p>

<p>As the girl tossed on her pillow she talked
incessantly, so that, bit by bit, Marion learned
her sad history, finding that, like herself, the
child had been born and bred in the country,
but had run away from her home only
to find treachery and disgrace in a conscienceless
city. The names of “father” and
“mother” were constantly on her lips. Then
there was another name which she tried to
speak, but which seemed always to be choked
back by a flood of agony or a torrent of bitter,
ill-timed denunciations.</p>

<p>Marion guessed that this name would
have meant a revelation. It was doubtless
the name of poor Kittie’s betrayer, which,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>for some reason or other, she could never
utter.</p>

<p>A sudden dislike to her own child was
the next development of the fever. When
she saw its tiny face she screamed and
shrieked with rage. It was necessary to remove
it from her sight entirely.</p>

<p>“It is a typical case,” said Miss Williams
to Marion. “You can study the chart as
much as you wish. It will not hurt you to
learn the tracings, even though you are a
‘probationer.’”</p>

<p>On the very next bed to Kittie lay an older
woman. She was also a mother and was
slowly dying of consumption.</p>

<p>As Kittie moaned and cried, this woman
wept silently. In her own dire distress she
was consumed with pity.</p>

<p>“Oh, the misery of it all,” she sighed, as
Marion bent over her. “Bless your dear
face, nurse, and may the good God keep you
from such wretchedness.”</p>

<p>Marion looked upon death for the first
time that night, for the poor consumptive
died without a sound or struggle.</p>

<p>Try as they would, they could not keep it
from Kittie. There was too much to be done,
too many to be cared for, to go into any extraordinary
effort at secrecy. As the stretcher
was carried out with the still, cold figure
upon it Kittie almost sprang from her bed
and tried to peer over the screen to look at it.</p>

<p>Marion caught her in her arms and pressed
her firmly back. The girl was screaming
with horror, and as strong as a lioness.</p>

<p>“She is my mother, I tell you!” she
shrieked over and over. “I saw her face
once. I am sure she is my mother!”</p>

<p>Miss Williams came to Marion’s help and
together they laid Kittie on her pillow. There
were shrieks and groans all over the ward,
for Kittie had excited all the other patients.</p>

<p>Marion would have gladly put her fingers
in her ears to shut out the sounds, but one
glance at Miss Williams’ face made her
ashamed of her cowardice.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the head nurse and an
assistant were moving about the ward—they
went from bed to bed, quieting and soothing
their patients.</p>

<p>Kittie was lying back exhausted on her
pillow now, and as she lay staring at Marion
her eyes seemed suddenly to emit a brilliant
lustre. Marion was fascinated by the glance
and sat staring back mutely. She held one
of Kittie’s hands and was stroking it absently.</p>

<p>Suddenly Kittie leaned a little toward her
and began to mutter. There was a fierce intensity
in her manner, as though she had determined
to impart something which must be
divulged.</p>

<p>Marion divined the poor girl’s message at
once. It was clear that she was about to
speak the forbidden name, and in spite of
herself Marion could not help feeling a deep
interest in the secret.</p>

<p>Over and over again Kittie struggled to
speak distinctly, but her throat seemed
parched and her tongue and lips unruly.</p>

<p>Marion held her head and gave her some
water, trying with wonderful self-control to
lay her back upon her pillow.</p>

<p>“I must! I must!” whispered the poor
girl, distinctly. “I must tell it to the world
for my baby’s sake. You shall know, every
one shall know my baby’s father.”</p>

<p>“Not now, dear,” said Marion, soothingly;
“another time. Lie down, Kittie, and be
calm. You will be better to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“To-morrow!” murmured the girl, hoarsely.
“To-morrow I shall be dead! To-night
I must speak! To-night or never.”</p>

<p>Marion saw that she could do nothing, so
she leaned sadly over the bed.</p>

<p>“If it will relieve your mind, Kittie, you
can whisper it to me softly. I will never tell.
It shall always be your secret.”</p>

<p>The burning eyes of the sick girl were
searching her face, and the claw-like fingers
which Marion held twitched and trembled
convulsively.</p>

<p>“No, no. I can’t speak it,” she said at last,
“but there is a picture—his picture—in the
bosom of my dress: the head nurse has it—ask
Miss Williams for it.”</p>

<p>She sank back upon her pillow completely
exhausted now. There was a change passing
over her face that even Marion noticed.</p>

<p>In a second Miss Williams was standing
beside the bed.</p>

<p>“Poor thing, it will soon be over,” she said,
sadly; “put the screen around her and go to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>Miss H——, Miss Marlowe. She is suffering
greatly, and I am too busy.”</p>

<p>“What! Leave Kittie now?” whispered
Marion in horror.</p>

<p>“She is dead,” said Miss Williams, with a
quick glance at Kittie. “The living first,
Miss Marlowe, the living and suffering.”</p>

<p>Marion went mutely across the ward, mastering
her grief as she went. In that one
short week she had learned to love Kittie.</p>

<p>“It will soon kill me at this rate,” she reasoned
to herself. “Oh, I must learn not to
sympathize so deeply with my patients.”</p>

<p>At sunrise the next morning Marion stood
by one of the windows of the hospital, looking
out upon the water, that glinted and
gleamed all around her.</p>

<p>A group of convicts were busy mending a
broken spot in the sea-wall, their two guards
standing idly by, each armed with a rifle.</p>

<p>“Here is the picture Kittie spoke of,” said
Miss Williams, coming up to her. “You can
look at it, Miss Marlowe, and then you must
go to bed. It is not necessary for you to
work day and night, even if you are a ‘probationer.’”</p>

<p>She slipped a picture into Marion’s hand
and went away. She was too busy herself
to think of sleeping. A great beam of the
golden sun fell upon the window panes at
that instant and Marion’s eyes were slightly
dazzled as she looked at the picture.</p>

<p>Then with a stifled scream Marion dropped
the bit of pasteboard from her hand.</p>

<p>It was a picture of Reginald Brookes—frank,
blue-eyed and handsome!</p>
<hr class="sect" />


<div class="chapter">
<h3 title="XII. A DESPERATE CHANCE">CHAPTER XII.<br />

<small>A DESPERATE CHANCE.</small></h3>
</div>
<p>For a few hours that day Marion remained
quietly in her room. She was not expected
on duty, and it was fortunate for her that
they could spare her.</p>

<p>She had returned the picture of Reginald
Brookes without a word to Miss Williams,
but the revelation it had brought to her distressed
her beyond expression.</p>

<p>“It must be a mistake,” she whispered over
and over. “The thing is impossible! It is
too utterly horrible!”</p>

<p>Then the dying girl’s words came back to
her distinctly. On her deathbed it was not
probable that Kittie would have told a falsehood.</p>

<p>Marion was glad when the batch of letters
was handed to her. They would serve to
take her mind from this dreadful subject.
The first letter was from Dollie, telling of her
success as a typewriter.</p>

<p>“I am getting on famously,” she wrote,
“and as my employer is old and bald, Ralph
has not yet become jealous. Miss Allyn and
I love our little flat better every day, and the
only thing we miss that would make us perfectly
happy is the daily companionship of my
darling sister.”</p>

<p>Marion smiled very happily as she folded
the letter.</p>

<p>“Dear Dollie! She is perfectly happy,
and, oh! I am so glad for her. Not for worlds
would I darken her life with so much as a
glimpse of the misery I am witnessing!”</p>

<p>The next letter was from her mother, and
Marion opened it eagerly. She was almost
sure to hear some news of Sallie. As she
read the first page her brow grew dark, and
at the end she crumpled the letter angrily in
her hand.</p>

<p>“Silas Johnson is a brute! Oh, how I
despise him!” she cried. “To think that he
received my letter and paid no attention to it!
He did not care enough about his wife to
even go and get her. Poor Sallie! I wonder
if she died in Bellevue, after all. Oh, I
almost wish I had followed the ambulance,
and I would have done it if I hadn’t promised
to take the <i>Thomas Brennan</i>.”</p>

<p>She paced the floor for awhile in great perplexity.
If Sallie was living she felt that she
must know it.</p>

<p>After a time she opened another letter. It
was from Mr. Ray, and her cheeks crimsoned
as she read it.</p>

<p>“After all, there is at least one good man
in the world yet,” she said, bitterly: “and they
are leaving England to-day, he and his sister,
and how happy I shall be to renew their acquaintance.”</p>

<p>As Marion went to pick up the last letter
she shrank back in alarm. The handwriting
was not familiar, but nevertheless she could
guess who was the writer.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>
<p>“I won’t read it! I won’t even touch it,”
she thought, indignantly. “How could he
write to me, the cowardly fellow!”</p>

<p>Then a feeling of shame passed over Marion’s
soul. She was condemning this man
unheard, which was not like her just nature.</p>

<p>“There must be some mistake,” she whispered
slowly. “Kittie may have found that
picture, or perhaps she was still delirious
when she told me. After all, why should I
believe so absolutely in a dying girl’s word?
Is not the brain sadly clouded and perhaps
entirely irresponsible at such a moment? No,
I will not convict him until I have heard his
story! It is only just, and I shall read his
letter.”</p>

<p>It was such a pleasant, jolly letter, yet
Marion almost shivered as she perused it
carefully.</p>

<p>It was not until she was putting the letter
back in the envelope that she discovered an
extra scrap of paper.</p>

<p>The doctor had thought of another word
to say, apparently, and there was not room
to add it to his already overfilled letter. Marion
read the slip of paper with dilated eyes.
The news it gave her was, to say the least,
extraordinary.</p>

<p>“By the way, Miss Marlowe,” the postscript
read, “a little maid servant of mother’s
ran away a couple of weeks or so ago, and
both mother and myself have worried considerably
about her. The cause of our worry
is simply that the child had been betrayed and
we had hoped to help her in her hour of trouble.
I mention this, knowing that such cases
land frequently in ‘Charity,’ so please keep
your eyes open for such a young lady. Her
name is Kittie, and she is about sixteen, and
very pretty.”</p>

<p>Marion passed her hand thoughtfully
across her brow. She was, if anything, more
mystified and astounded than ever.</p>

<p>“If he is guilty, then no words can describe
him,” she said, finally, “for he must be a fiend
incarnate if he could wrong the girl and then
sit down calmly and write such a letter.”</p>

<p>Marion was glad when the hour for duty
came. She hurried back to her ward as to
a haven of refuge.</p>

<p>That night, after sunset, Marion went out
for a walk about the Island. She went alone
from preference, as she wished to do some
hard thinking.</p>

<p>Young Dr. Brookes had said that he would
see her the next day, as he had found an excellent
excuse for running over to the Island.</p>

<p>“What shall I say to him?” Marion asked
herself as she stood on the sea-wall and gazed
out over the water.</p>

<p>A squad of convicts passed near her as she
stood there. They were marching with the
prison “lockstep,” which was now becoming
familiar to Marion.</p>

<p>The young girl did not turn her eyes, for
she dreaded to see them. A look at their
rough faces always made her heart ache
sadly.</p>

<p>As she stood in her simple frock, with her
big white apron, she made a picture of beauty
such as had never been seen on the Island.</p>

<p>Pretty faces and sweet faces had been seen
there from time to time, but this willowy girl,
with her mass of chestnut hair and her splendid
head set on such graceful shoulders,
would have attracted attention from any man
in the land, then how much more the attention
of these imprisoned unfortunates.</p>

<p>Not one convict alone, but a dozen of them
glanced at her.</p>

<p>There was a sharp command from the
guard, followed by a sullen answer. The
next second, before Marion realized what
was happening, there came a splash in the
water. One of the convicts in desperation
had leaped into the river.</p>

<p>“Forward! March!” cried a guard, in almost
furious tones.</p>

<p>The squad moved on toward the penitentiary
without so much as turning their heads,
while one of the guards, rifle in hand, stepped
quickly to the wall beside Marion.</p>

<p>“Come back, or I’ll fire!” he called out,
sternly, as a smooth shaven head appeared
slowly above the surface.</p>

<p>Marion reached up instinctively and
grasped the guard’s arm.</p>

<p>“Don’t! don’t!” she gasped, “He will come
back: I am sure of it!”</p>

<p>The man’s gaze never wavered from the
bend above the water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>“If I had a boat I could save him,” he said,
very coolly, “but I haven’t, and I must get
him. That’s all there is about it!”</p>

<p>“You mean he must not escape?” said Marion,
in agony.</p>

<p>“I lose my job if he does,” was the sullen
answer. Then he raised the rifle, with one
finger on the trigger.</p>

<p>“Once more, come back or I’ll fire!” he
bawled, distinctly.</p>

<p>There was a little splash in the water as
the swimmer turned around.</p>

<p>“You can fire and be d—d!” he shouted,
hoarsely.</p>

<p>Marion covered her eyes, so that she could
not see what happened.</p>

<p>There was a report of a rifle that echoed
across the water.</p>

<p>“Hell Gate” or its vicinity had received another
victim.</p>

<p>As Marion rushed back to the hospital a
boat moved slowly away from the little dock.
It was the boat from Bellevue and had left
its usual quota of patients. The horrible
scene which she had just witnessed was one
which she knew would remain with her always
and which she would almost have given
her life to have prevented.</p>

<p>“Oh, how terrible his life must have been!”
she thought, “if the poor fellow preferred
death in such a horrible manner.”</p>

<p>Then, curiously enough, on the very steps
of the hospital she came face to face with the
“Bible reader.”</p>

<p>“What has happened?” asked the woman,
as she read Marion’s horrified expression.</p>

<p>“A convict shot and drowned,” was the
young girl’s low answer. “Another victim
has paid the penalty of sin or weakness!”</p>

<p>“Unrepentant, unforgiven,” murmured the
woman, in horror.</p>

<p>The young girl turned upon her with an
agonized countenance.</p>

<p>“We cannot say that—we do not know,”
she said very sharply; then she fled hastily
up the steps and into the building.</p>

<p>In order to reach the floor Marion had to
pass the reception ward, and, as usual, she
glanced in at the door in passing.</p>

<p>There was something going on that was
out of the ordinary, but she was too upset to
inquire into its meaning.</p>

<p>All that night the scene that she had witnessed
haunted her, and she arose the next
morning looking pale and haggard. As she
left her room the Superintendent of Nurses
met her. She was a middle-aged woman,
rather stout and very dignified.</p>

<p>“I am going to transfer you to the medical
ward for awhile, Miss Marlowe,” she
said, briefly. “You can go in there at once
and report to Miss Franklin.”</p>

<p>Marion bowed and turned in the direction
indicated. It was a sad disappointment to
her to be obliged to leave the “Maternity.”
“I almost love Miss Williams,” she said to
herself, “but as I seem to have a faculty for
loving almost everybody, perhaps I shall love
Miss Franklin.”</p>

<p>As she reached the entrance to the ward
she stopped a moment. There were several
new patients being put to bed, and Miss
Franklin was busy.</p>

<p>Suddenly from the direction of the patients’
elevator there came a fearful shriek.</p>

<p>Marion’s face turned pale and her knees
trembled as she heard it.</p>

<p>Miss Franklin darted past her just as the
elevator stopped and let out an orderly and
two doctors, who were all struggling with a
patient.</p>

<p>Marion shrank back against the wall to
give them a chance to pass her, and as she
did so she overheard the house physician saying
something to Miss Franklin.</p>

<p>“It developed yesterday as she was coming
up on the boat. I’ll have her transferred
to Ward’s Island to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“And meanwhile we’ll have all the other
patients standing on their heads,” was Miss
Franklin’s curt answer. “It seems to me
that all the lunatics are brought straight to
the ‘Medical’!”</p>

<p>“Can’t help it this time,” said the doctor,
smiling, “and you know you can manage her
the best of any one, Miss Franklin.”</p>

<p>The head nurse flushed at this genuine
compliment. She was as conscientious as she
was exacting, and such words were her recompense.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>
<p>For the next few minutes everything was
in commotion, for with a sudden effort the
new patient sprang from the orderly’s
arms and, rushing the length of the ward,
bounded up on a table which held some charts
and glasses.</p>

<p>“Quick! before she secures a weapon!”
said the doctor to the orderly in a low, fierce
tone.</p>

<p>The orderly sprang forward, but he was a
minute too late. The woman had snatched
a couple of glasses and cracked them together.
With a piece of jagged glass in each
hand she stood, alert and waiting.</p>

<p>Just at this very moment Marion took a
step into the ward. She opened her eyes
wider as she stared hard at the woman.</p>

<p>“Come on, Sile, and I’ll finish you!”
shrieked the poor, crazy woman defiantly.
“Jest strike me ag’in, yer coward, an’ I’ll kill
yer, Silas Johnson!”</p>

<p>“My goodness! It is Sallie!” cried Marion
with a gasp. “Oh, be careful of her,
doctor! It is Sallie! Poor, dear Sallie.”</p>

<p>Before Marion could say more Miss
Franklin stood before her.</p>

<p>“Hush! you simpleton!” she said, sternly.</p>

<p>“Don’t you see what you are doing? Is it
any reason because you know her that you
should frighten all the patients!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m so sorry,” cried Marion, who was
scarlet with embarrassment. “I will not
make another sound—only do let me go to
her.”</p>

<p>Miss Franklin smiled in a sarcastic way.
“Certainly, go to her if you wish and quiet
her if you can. She evidently takes the
orderly for some other person.”</p>

<p>“She thinks he is Silas Johnson, her husband,”
said Marion, as she started down the
ward. “Oh, can it be possible that this is
poor Sallie!”</p>

<p>“Don’t go near her yet, miss,” said the
orderly, as Marion approached. “She’s ‘as
mad as a March hare.’ She’d cut your face
open with that glass in a minute. We’ve got
to do a little planning to capture the lady.”</p>

<p>Marion looked at Sallie as she crouched
on the table. Her face was ashen, her eyes
red and glaring, and her hair, which was
always poor Sallie’s one beauty, fell in unkempt
masses over her back and shoulders.</p>

<p>Not once did she take her burning gaze
from the face of the orderly, and fierce, undying
hatred was stamped upon her features.</p>

<p>“If you will only go away, I am sure I can
calm her,” said Marion, bravely. “Sallie will
not hurt me—even if she is crazy.”</p>

<p>“You can go, orderly,” said the physician,
who was close to Marion. “I think this nurse
can quiet the girl, and I don’t wish to resort
to force if it can be avoided.”</p>

<p>Marion thanked him with a smile, and the
orderly backed away with a grin of delight.</p>

<p>It was not always pleasant to be taken for
a crazy woman’s husband.</p>

<p>“Sallie! Sallie! Don’t you know me?”
asked Marion, softly, as she walked up slowly
and stood beside the table.</p>

<p>The maniac did not notice her until the
orderly had disappeared, then with a sigh of
relief she dropped the sharp weapons that she
had been clutching.</p>

<p>“He’ll never strike me again now, Marion,”
she cried, shrilly, “I’ve done jest as yer said.
I’ve defied him at last, an’ now I’m goin’ ter
run away an’ go tew the city.”</p>
<hr class="sect" />


<h3 title="XIV. MARION’S FIRST PROPOSAL">CHAPTER XIV.<br />

<small>MARION’S FIRST PROPOSAL.</small></h3>

<p>It was several days before Sallie recovered
her senses, but she had not been transferred,
much to Marion’s satisfaction.</p>

<p>With the last disappearing trace of fever
her reason was slowly restored, and her delight
was unbounded when she found herself
with Marion.</p>

<p>“I’ll never go back,” she said over and over.
“I’ll learn tew do nursing and stay right here,
Marion. Do beg them tew let me stay! I
know I can be useful.”</p>

<p>But Sallie was destined to go back to Silas,
although not exactly in the manner she had
imagined.</p>

<p>A letter from Deacon Marlowe informed
Marion of Silas Johnson’s death. He had
been killed by a fall on the ice in his own
meadow. Neither Marion nor Sallie said
much about the news, but they were both too
frank and honest to express any sham sorrow.</p>

<p>Marion’s first leave of absence was to put
Sallie on the train and send her back to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>Hickorytown, a weak, wasted woman. Before
they started down to the boat Miss Williams
came out in the corridor and handed
something to Marion. It was a small, flat
package done up in brown paper. “I found
them pinned to poor Kittie’s one frock,” she
said, sadly, “and as the child had no friends
and the baby is dead, I thought perhaps you
would like to have them.”</p>

<p>Marion took the parcel with a curious feeling
of horror. It seemed a dreadful way to
become possessor of Reginald Brookes’ picture.</p>

<p>“I’ll keep them,” she said, slowly, “for I
did love the girl, and perhaps I may be able
to learn something about her some day.”</p>

<p>On her way to the little flat Marion mailed
a note to Reginald Brookes, for she had decided
at last that she must settle the matter
of the picture.</p>

<p>He had called at the hospital twice, but she
had been too busy to see him. Thanks to
her work, the excuse was genuine in both instances.</p>

<p>“Oh, Marion! I’m so glad!” cried Dollie
as she admitted her. “That dear old ‘baldy’
of mine has given me a day’s vacation. If he
hadn’t I would have missed you, and that
would have been awful.”</p>

<p>Miss Allyn came in and hugged Marion enthusiastically,
and in a very short time they
were all seated at a cozy dinner.</p>

<p>“I want you to tell me something, Alma,”
said Marion, after she had heard all the news
and both girls looked at her quickly, there
was so much seriousness in her manner.</p>

<p>“What is it, dear?” asked Miss Allyn, curiously.</p>

<p>“I want you to tell me what you know of
Reginald Brookes,” said Marion, quietly.
“There is a reason why I should know all
that I can possibly learn about him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Marion, he hasn’t proposed to you
already, has he?” asked Dollie.</p>

<p>“No, indeed,” said Marion, laughing, “but
I have another reason for wishing to know
all I can about him. I will tell you both what
it is just as soon as I think I am right in
doing so.”</p>

<p>“Well, I will tell you what I know,” said
Miss Allyn, blushing a little. “I’ve known
Reginald Brookes ever since he was born, so
I think I can speak with some authority.”</p>

<p>Marion held her breath and bent forward
to listen, and the eagerness in her manner
did not escape Miss Allyn.</p>

<p>“Regie Brookes is one of the best and
noblest fellows that ever lived,” she said, distinctly,
“and on a certain occasion, several
years ago, I was fool enough to refuse to
marry him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Miss Allyn!” gasped Dollie, “was Dr.
Brookes in love with you and did you throw
him over on account of that—that Mr. Colebrook?”</p>

<p>“I guess those are about the facts in the
case,” said Miss Allyn, bitterly. “Some
women are big geese where men are concerned,
but I wasn’t simply a goose, I was a
whole flock,” she added, laughing.</p>

<p>“Do you suppose he is all over it?” asked
Dollie, who was beginning to feel sympathetic.</p>

<p>“I hope so, I am sure,” said Miss Allyn,
quickly. “Why, that was years ago—we
were almost children.”</p>

<p>“You would not believe him guilty of
wronging a poor girl, would you?” asked
Marion, her cheeks tingling as she said it.</p>

<p>“Never!” cried Miss Allyn, emphatically.
“He could not do it! Regie Brookes is the
soul of chivalry and honor!”</p>

<p>“Then, I will tell you what I mean,” said
Marion, slowly, and she repeated the sad
story of Kittie’s death and the subsequent detail
of the photograph now in her possession.</p>

<p>When she had finished her story, Dollie
looked bewildered, but Miss Allyn’s expression
of absolute faith had not changed an
atom.</p>

<p>“Let me see the picture,” she said at once.</p>

<p>Marion drew the little package from her
pocket and started to open it.</p>

<p>“I suppose it is in here; Miss Williams
said it contained all of poor Kittie’s treasures,”
she said as she tore off the paper and
laid the contents on the table.</p>

<p>There was a handkerchief, a bit of ribbon
and a brass locket in the package. Then Marion
caught her breath as she discovered two
pictures.</p>

<p>“This is his!” cried Miss Allyn, snatching
up the one of young Brookes.</p>

<p>There was a glad cry from Marion at the
very same minute. She was staring hard at
the other picture.</p>

<p>“Oh, how wrong I was! How unjust!”
she cried, remorsefully. “See! here is the
picture of another young man, and Kittie has
left no doubt as to who he is, for she has
scrawled across the back of it, ‘This is the
father of my baby.’”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>
<p>The girls both looked at the picture and
the words which were written on it, while
Marion censured herself in the most vigorous
language.</p>

<p>“He is a common-looking fellow, almost
brutal,” said Dollie, looking again at the picture.
“Oh, what a pity Miss Williams hadn’t
found this first! I can see by her face that
Marion has suffered!”</p>

<p>“I have, indeed,” said Marion, honestly.
“It nearly killed me to think so badly of the
doctor.”</p>

<p>“Well, you were not altogether to blame,”
said Miss Allyn, consolingly. “The circumstances
were startling. It would have convinced
almost any one.”</p>

<p>There was a peal at the bell as Miss Allyn
spoke, and the next moment Dollie had
ushered a caller into the little parlor.</p>

<p>“It is Dr. Brookes,” whispered Marion to
Miss Allyn. “I asked him to come, but do
you know I almost dread to face him, now
that I know how I have wronged him.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” said Miss Allyn, sensibly.
“Just put that out of your mind, Marion.
You did him an injustice and have regretted
it sincerely. There is no use in torturing
yourself by telling him about it.”</p>

<p>“But his picture,” said Marion, a little helplessly.</p>

<p>“Tell him exactly how you got it, and he
will probably explain. No doubt the girl stole
it while she was working for his mother.”</p>

<p>Marion took her advice and followed it
carefully, telling him, in the presence of her
friends, of Kittie’s death, but without mentioning
the poor girl’s words about the picture.</p>

<p>Dr. Brookes looked grieved to hear of the
girl’s death, but he smiled when he saw the
photograph of himself. It was just as Miss
Allyn had guessed—the little maid had stolen
it.</p>

<p>“The first instance on record of any young
lady caring enough about me to want my picture,”
remarked the young man, with a mischievous
glance at Miss Allyn.</p>

<p>For once the young lady was not ready
with a gay reply, and Marion, with great
tact, managed to turn the conversation.</p>

<p>After a little while both Dollie and Miss
Allyn excused themselves, and Marion and
Reginald Brookes were alone together.</p>

<p>“Miss Marlowe,” said the doctor, after they
had been chatting for some time, “I came here
to-night on a rather serious errand. I hope
I shall not frighten you by telling you about
it, but honestly I can’t keep it to myself much
longer.”</p>

<p>He spoke so earnestly and so gently that
Marion’s cheeks flushed in an instant. She
seemed to feel what was coming, although
she tried not to show it.</p>

<p>“You are a dear, good girl, Miss Marlowe,”
he whispered, coming closer to her
on the sofa, “and I’m an impetuous chap—I
can’t make love on schedule! You see, it’s
this way,” he went on, talking eagerly, “I
fell in love with you that night on the train.
It came over me in a second, and I couldn’t
resist it. Not that I tried very hard,” he
said, laughing a little and pressing the slender
fingers that he had found and imprisoned.</p>

<p>“But you don’t know me at all, Dr.
Brookes,” Marion tried to answer.</p>

<p>“Oh, I do, indeed!” was the ardent reply.
“I know that you are good and brave and
noble. I know that your sister and Miss
Allyn love you dearly. Then my mother almost
fell in love with you that evening, too,
and last, but not least, I know that I love
you, and if that isn’t enough I’d like to know
what is lacking.”</p>

<p>He was kneeling close by her side now,
looking up into her eyes, and as Marion saw
his handsome face, with its candid, fearless
expression, she felt overwhelmed with shame
that she had ever doubted him.</p>

<p>Still, he was waiting for her to answer and
she must be perfectly honest: She liked him
exceedingly well, but did she love him?</p>

<p>Almost as if for answer, the dark, pleading
face of Mr. Ray seemed to rise before her
vision. Marion caught her breath quickly
and her voice trembled as she answered:</p>

<p>“Wait—please wait,” she murmured, with
a bewitching smile. “I do not know my own
mind yet—and your words are so unexpected.”</p>

<p>“All right, Marion,” said the young man,
as he touched his lips to her hand. “I will
wait, of course, for I do not wish you to be
mistaken, but, oh, Marion, dear, do please
try to love me!”</p>

<p>The last glance between them was one of
loyal friendship. As he bade her good night
Marion was proud that he loved her.</p>

<p>“It will all come right some day,” she murmured
to herself. “Some day my heart will
choose between them, but until then the duties
of life are before me and I must go patiently
on in the career I have chosen.”</p>

<p>“My dear Miss Shirley, will you please answer
this question? I would not dream of asking it if
it was not such a serious matter. Is there any
subject relating to matrimony and married life
that is too indelicate for my fiance and myself to
discuss before marriage? There are one or two
things that I wish to settle, and my mother says
I would be unmaidenly to even whisper them.
Please give me your candid opinion on the subject.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Lena W.</span>”</p></div>

<p>Absolute confidence between engaged people
and a perfect understanding of each other’s wishes
and temperaments is the surest possible foundation
for a successful marriage. The ignorance
which is taken to the altar does not affect two
people alone, but is perpetuated frequently for
many generations, and is always accompanied
with misunderstanding and misery. It is a
mother’s part to look into such questions as
have embarrassed my correspondent. Some mothers
are sadly negligent in their duty towards
their children. A little plain speech would have
saved much suffering. All subjects are holy that
have to do with the solemn obligations of matrimony.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>“I have been engaged for three years and expect
to be married next spring. Now that I am
almost face to face with this change in my life
that I have anticipated with so much pleasure, I
am ashamed to confess that I almost dread it. I
love my betrothed dearly, but I am so afraid
that I shall not be happy when my whole existence
is wrapped up in him and his affairs. All
the time that we have been engaged I have seen
other friends, and we have both gone out a great
deal. When I become a married woman I am
afraid that I shall find the monotony unbearable.
Do you think that I am very wicked to feel so,
and had I better postpone my marriage for a
time?</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Alice D. K.</span>”</p></div>

<p>Your diffidence is not an unusual feeling, nor
one of which to be ashamed. No woman of delicate
sensibilities can face so radical a change in
her whole existence without nervousness.</p>

<p>Those who take such a matter calmly are thicker
skinned than their sisters. There is no reason
why the “monotony” should be unbearable. You
and your husband can still enjoy the pleasures
of society, but enjoy them together, and there is
nothing more pleasant in life than the chat together
after the ball or party or theatre. When
you have both devoted yourselves to entertaining
others for an evening you will be glad indeed
to have your husband get your wrapper and slippers
for you and to cuddle up on a cozy armchair
and talk the evening’s events over with him before
you sleep.</p>

<p>“I am in deep trouble and know of no one to
turn to but you, dear Miss Shirley. I have been
engaged to a young man for over a year, and we
expected to be married this winter. Last night he
told me that he did not want to marry me unless
I knew everything about him, and then he told
me that he had once stolen a large sum of money
from his employer, and that he had been arrested,
but his father paid the money back and he
was released. Since then he has paid his father
back and has been upright and made his way in
the world; but it seems awful to me to marry a
man with almost the shadow of a crime hanging
over him. Won’t you tell me what you think
about it?</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Minnie A.</span>”</p></div>

<p>The poet says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">“I hold it truth with him who sings—</div>
      <div class="verse indent2">That men may rise on stepping stones</div>
      <div class="verse">Of their dead selves to higher things.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>That a man has stepped aside and repented is
the best possible proof of his integrity. If you
cannot value a lover who is honest enough to
want to come to you with his whole life open as
a book for you to read, you cannot have much
appreciation of true manliness. The man who can
live down a thing like that and make his way in
the world afterward is a man to be proud of, and
we judge that he is well worthy of any girl’s true
affection. If you loved him you would not hesitate
a moment, but would help him to forget the
past and to “go forward to meet the shadowy
future without fear and with a manly heart.”</p>

<p>We wish that we knew the young man personally
so that we could clasp his hand in friendship
and tell him that we would stand by him in his
earnest endeavor.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>“I am at variance with my lover on a subject
that I am afraid deeply concerns our future happiness.
My lover is a Unitarian while I and my
family have always been Episcopalians. We
differ on religious matters now, and I am afraid
that our differences will be more serious after
marriage. My family and myself have all been at
him to join our church, but he won’t do it.</p>

<p>“Ought I to insist upon his accepting my faith
with me or should that be left open for discussion
after we are married?</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Grace P.</span>”</p></div>

<p>If the question of a belief is more important to
you than the affection of your lover we advise
you to relinquish him at once. True love will not
let such subjects as religion or politics interfere
with its tranquillity. No doubt your lover’s belief
is quite as precious to him as yours is to you
and if you cannot win him over by intelligent,
kindly arguments you had better allow him to
follow his own inclinations. Always remember
that the right to disagree belongs to every individual,
but there is no reason for such disagreement
being a source of misery. In a general way,
we would advise settling all such matters before
marriage. Bickering is bad enough when people
are not bound to each other by any tie, but it is
ten-fold worse when there is a compact between
them.</p>

<p>Your lover has as much right to his religious
views as you have to yours, and the sooner you
recognize that right—the sooner you will have
proved your own true womanliness.</p>

only one that I really care anything about, and
I’m not sure that I care anything for him. I do

bargain.</p>

<p>Your letter seems to us to be a candid admission
of your feelings. You do not state your age,
but we should imagine that you were young and
just a little foolish.</p>

<p>We hardly think you have experienced the
feeling called love, although your evident pity
for the one young man’s feelings is akin to the
sentiment. You should endeavor to redeem your
reputation at once as the sobriquet of “Flirt” is
not very desirable. You will never win the love
of a good man so long as you show that your nature
is fickle. We should advise you to devote
your time to your work or your books and try to
develop your character. In this way you may be
able to discover your exact feelings towards the
young man whom you seem to prefer at present.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>“In spite of the fact that I have steadily repulsed
him, a young man of my acquaintance
has stuck to me for months. I have told him
plainly that I do not believe that I will ever really
love any one, but he has persisted in showing
me attention, and now I almost look to him for
all my friendship, for the other men, I am sure, do
not really care for me—they are just flirting like
I am myself. I know this one would propose if I
gave him the chance, but I won’t give him an
opportunity unless I am going to accept him.
Do you think I would be doing him an injury to
marry him? I am not vicious, but I am afraid
that I would want to flirt after marriage just the
same as I do now.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Olive W.</span>”</p></div>

<p>By no means marry this young man until you
are sure you love him. There have been too
many of these uncertain marriages made already
without your swelling the number.</p>

<p>A woman who would “flirt” after marriage
must be terribly lacking in dignity, and if she
does not respect herself she cannot expect to be
respected. We should judge that the young man
you speak of is a very nice person, and we sincerely
hope for his sake that he will marry an
honest, self-respecting woman.</p>

<p>“We live in the suburbs, and I have been coming
to New York to matinees ever since I wore
long dresses. I met a fellow at a continuous performance
one afternoon, and we struck up an acquaintance.</p>

<p>“Since then I have corresponded with him and
have met him in the city a number of times, and
had luncheon with him. Now he wants me to go
to the theatre with him some evening and spend
the night at his boarding-place.</p>

<p>“I have met his landlady and she is simply lovely
and I know she will see that I come to no
harm. But would I be doing wrong to accept the
invitation?</p>

<p>“Some of my girl friends say that I could not
do worse, and some of them say that it is no
worse to spend the night in the city than to spend
the entire day—as I have done, several times.</p>

<p>“Won’t you please advise me, as I am only
nineteen years old and realize that I can’t judge
for myself.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Isabel F. A.</span>”</p></div>

<p>We cannot quite understand your letter, Isabel.
In all our experience we have never heard of
anything so extraordinary! If the young man
you speak of was living at home with his mother
and sisters, and it was their invitation we could
find no fault with your staying under the same
roof with your friend, but the idea of your staying
at his boarding-house is beyond the bounds
of respectability, and in spite of her smiles, no
one would think worse of you than his landlady.
The manner in which you met this young man is
thoroughly unconventional. Be careful that your
acquaintance with him does not terminate disastrously.
You speak very truly when you say you
“cannot judge for yourself,” but at nineteen
years of age you should show more wisdom and
discretion. We are inclined to be suspicious of
this young man’s motives; but a girl who allows
herself to be “picked up” at a continuous performance,
as the saying is, can hardly expect to
be treated any differently. You had better discontinue
this acquaintance if you do not wish
trouble.</p>

<p>“Do you object to advising a young man, Miss
Shirley? I am nineteen years old and am engaged
to be married. The girl I love is very large
and stout, she weighs nearly 200. I weigh only
138, and that is what is the matter. Don’t you
think I would be foolish to marry such a big girl,
even if I do love her? What in the world would
I do if she should grow any bigger? I’d look foolish
and feel foolish every time I went out with
her. Of course, I want to do what is right. I
know she’d never get another fellow because of
her size. Do you think I ought to marry her and
be a martyr?</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">James L.</span>”</p></div>

<p>No, James, we do not advise you to play the
“martyr,” but it is not altogether because of
your sweetheart’s size, but because we are confident
that you do not love her. Why, James, if
you really loved her, you would be delighted
to think there was so much of her! We are sorry
for the girl, but we do not agree with you that
she will never have another lover. We feel sure
that some noble, honest fellow will fall in love
with her some day and be more than glad to
marry her in spite of her superfluous adipose
tissue. We fancy your soul is about as small as
your body. At any rate, you are sadly lacking in
moral courage.</p>
<hr class="sect" />

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>“I have a very serious question to ask you,
dear Miss Shirley, it is this: Can a girl love two
men and love them both sincerely? I have never
heard of any one doing it, but I confess that this
is exactly my predicament. I love two young
men and could be happy with either of them.
Do you think it better not to marry either, or
would it be safe for me to marry the first one
that asks me? I feel sure that they will both
propose before long.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Nina B.</span>”</p></div>

<p>Your question does not impress us as being
very serious. If you are so general in your affection
you might toss up a cent to see which you
should marry. Apparently you are easily pleased
in the matter of a husband. For the sake of the
young men, however, we trust you will not marry
either one. If they are honest young men they
each deserve a good wife, one who will love
them and them alone, with true, loyal affection.</p>
<hr class="sect" />

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>“The girls in the school that I attend all enjoy
athletics, and we recently organized a football
team. We wear a suit with trousers like the boys
wear for the game with a short skirt over them
that reaches almost to our knees. No one found
any fault with our fun until this week when several
of the more strait-laced people in the town
complained to some of our parents that they
thought it was immodest for us to go through
the streets to the grounds where we play wearing
our costume. Won’t you let me know what
you think about it?</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Etta W.</span>”</p></div>

<p>Dr. Mary Walker has worn trousers for years,
and she is a very estimable woman, still we have
never heard of her playing football. It does not
seem to us to be objectionable at all, for trousers
and short skirts are certainly very convenient
and healthful. You did not say how old the girls
in your school are, but if they are over sixteen
we would certainly advise them to give up football.
There are many other games just as healthful,
and far more graceful. I hope you girls have
not been trying to kick the knobs off of the gate
posts as you went to and from your play. Girls
who imitate boys are sometimes given to these
pranks, and in that event we do not blame the
natives for complaining.</p>
<hr class="sect" />

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>“This seems almost a foolish subject for me to
write to you about, Miss Shirley, but I hope you
will find time to answer me. The young man
whom I am engaged to simply hates pet animals.
Now, I have a pet cat that I raised from a wee
little kitten, and I love her and all animals
dearly. Frank is always teasing her and grumbling
if I pet her. I have been wondering if a
man with this disposition would make a good
husband. It seems absurd sometimes even to me
to think it would make any difference in our
married life, but I have thought about this one
trait of his so much that I want to hear what
your opinion is.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Carrie S. S.</span>”</p></div>

<p>We are very sorry indeed to learn of this trait
in your betrothed. It shows a bad disposition to
dislike animals, yet it does not always follow
that a man will be unkind to a woman because of
that trait in his disposition. Personally I would
not have a man about who was unkind to animals,
and I am inclined to think that such a man
would be apt to make almost any woman unhappy.
The poor animals suffer enough, and
there is no one to protect them but ourselves.
If we neglect this duty it seems to me that we
are culpable and deserve, even if we do not receive,
some severe form of punishment. We do
not blame you at all for feeling as you do, and
advise you to try and reform your lover, if possible.</p>
<hr class="sect" />

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>“Please answer this question and oblige a constant
reader: Is it proper to allow a young man
to put his arm around you when you are riding
in the surface cars or elevated, or when you are
coming home from Coney Island on the boat. I
have allowed my escort to do so several times,
and some of my girl friends say that it looks very
silly. I am in love with this young man and he
is in love with me. Is there any harm in our
showing our affection?</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Laura.</span>”</p></div>

<p>The habit of hugging in public is certainly very
bad taste, and we agree with your friends that it
also looks silly. In the first place, unless the
young man is engaged to you he has no right to
embrace you at all, and you would be much more
modest and ladylike if you refused to allow him
such privileges in public. Embraces are but the
demonstrations of holy affection. They should
not be paraded before the eyes of the public.</p>
<hr class="sect" />

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>“Do you think it is wrong for a married woman
to engage in business? I have a desirable situation
offered me, and am tempted to accept it, but
my husband objects so decidedly that I have
doubted the propriety of my idea of working.
My husband seems to feel that I have no right to
work, and says that he will not live with me if
I do.</p>

<p>“We have no children and I would be glad of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>the occupation. Please let me have your advice
on the matter.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Mrs. Ella W.</span>”</p></div>

<p>We see no harm in your engaging in business
with your husband’s consent, but if he does not
wish it and can provide well for you without, we
should certainly advise you to yield to his wishes.
Married women can discover many home occupations
and amusements, and in other ways develop
their minds and talents. There is no necessity
for home life becoming monotonous. The
question of propriety does not enter into the
subject. Consider your husband’s wishes because
you love him and do not disagree with him unless
it is a matter of principle. What did you
marry him for if you wanted to go into business?
If he had desired a business woman for a wife he
would probably have married one.</p>
<hr class="sect" />

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>“I am eighteen years of age and am very much
in love with a young man, but there are several
things about him which annoy me exceedingly,
and I hope you will be kind enough to give me
your opinion. This young man wears very good
clothing, but when we go out together I frequently
notice that his garments need brushing,
his linen is soiled and his finger nails are in a
dreadful condition. Are these faults serious, or
are they only trifles? I have been brought up to
be very particular, but I do not intend to be
over-fastidious. Ought not a man to always be
clean shaven when he goes out with a lady?</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Arabella W.</span>”</p></div>

<p>We can understand your feelings perfectly, my
dear girl, for there is hardly anything more repulsive
than uncleanly habits. It is possible the
young man has had no training in this direction,
but, of course, this does not excuse him entirely.
We would advise you to use a little tact in
throwing out hints.</p>

<p>Speak admiringly of the neat habits of others
whom you meet, and see if you cannot awaken
him to a sense of his own shortcomings. If he
does not mend his ways, and you really intend
to marry him, we should advise you to call his
attention to each defect, kindly and considerately.
If he becomes indignant and refuses to yield
to your suggestions, we would certainly advise
you to give him up. “Cleanliness is next to godliness,”
and it is much easier to acquire. There
is no excuse for either man or woman possessing
uncleanly habits.</p>
<hr class="sect" />

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>“A young man whom I have known for a
month has asked me to marry him. He is handsome
and agreeable, and I love him dearly. Do
you think it is wrong to marry on such short acquaintance?
He is nearly six feet tall and looks
lovely on horseback. It will break my heart if
you advise me not to marry him.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Lida D. B.</span>”</p></div>

<p>Poor Lida! We feel sorry for you, but what
can we say? We have no desire to break your
heart, but if we answer you at all we must try to
speak honestly.</p>

<p>Because a man is “six feet tall” and looks
“lovely on horseback,” you must not take it for
granted that he will make a good husband. It
would be far better for you to endeavor to find
out about his character and ability to support you
before you fall so completely into the toils. We
have seen many short acquaintances turn out
satisfactorily, but we do not think it wise to enter
into so important an alliance rashly unless
each has previously been aware of the good character
of the other. Try to curb your impressionable
heart, Lida, until you are sure the young
man is worthy of you.</p>
<hr class="sect" />

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>“I have been engaged to be married for nearly
three years, but am beginning to despair of the
marriage ever being consummated. The young
man to whom I am engaged is a very closemouthed
person, and I cannot find out what business
he is engaged in, but every time I hint at
matrimony he pleads poverty as an excuse for
deferring the ceremony. I have seen him with
fifty dollars in his pocket several times. Is not
this enough to pay for a wedding?</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Sarah B.</span>”</p></div>

<p>We judge by your letter that the young man is
not very deeply in love with you, and the fact
that he does not tell you his business looks very
suspicious. If a man has not sufficient confidence
in you to tell you by what vocation he earns his
living we should advise you to let him go and
turn your attention to some one who is more
open and candid. Fifty dollars will pay the minister,
buy the ring, and furnish a supper, but it
will not go far after the festivities are over. If
that is the most he can call his own at any one
time he is hardly in a position to take upon himself
the responsibilities of a husband.</p>
<hr class="sect" />

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>“Will you kindly do me the favor to answer
the following questions? Does a naturally domineering
man grow more gentle after marriage,
and would you advise a young girl to marry a
person with this disposition?</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Addie S.</span>”</p></div>

<p>Domineering men are sometimes made gentle
by love, but, as a rule, matrimony only aggravates
such a nature. A man who will dictate to a
woman before marriage is quite likely to prove a
tyrant after. We know of no habit that is much
harder to cure than this, and would consider
matrimony a very heroic measure. It would be
much better for you to treat the disease with dignity
and firmness before marriage and note the
results. When you are once married it will be
too late to experiment.</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
